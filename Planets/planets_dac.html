      <div class="card-body">
        <p class="card-text">Known as Mon Calamari in official
          Republic and Imperial records, or simply Mon Cala,
          the ocean-covered world is called Dac by the native
          Mon Calamari and Quarren species. Mon Calamari
          is a relative newcomer to the Republic. Its remote
          location in the Outer Rim, away from the traditional
          major hyperroutes, deterred early exploration by
          ancient Republic scouts.</p>
        <p class="card-text">It was out in space where the Republic and Mon
          Calamari ships first made contact. The Mon Calamari
          were encouraged, and sought further study and communications with their new, fascinating neighbors.
          The Quarren were much more cautious. They feared
          the Mon Calamari were moving much too quickly. This
          division marked the end of a period of cooperation
          between the species. The division only got worse as
          the Republic deteriorated into the Empire.</p>
        <p class="card-text">The Empire wasted no time in taking control of
          the system and the shipyards. The Mon Calamari
          attempted to negotiate. When that failed, the Empire
          attacked, benefiting from friendly Quarren who
          believed Imperial control was necessary especially at
          the expense of the Mon Calamari.</p>
        <p class="card-text">The Imperials proved unable to convert the shipyards
          to produce Imperial standard craft. While they
          tried, Mon Calamari resistance groups organized and
          began fighting back through nonviolent means. Eventually,
          the Imperials retaliated with a devastating
          orbital bombardment against three floating cities.</p>
        <p class="card-text">Instead of buckling under the pressure, both the
          Mon Calamari and the Quarren openly fought back.
          They secretly modified many ships for combat and
          harassed the Imperial fleet incessantly. Eventually,
          the Imperials concluded that holding Mon Calamari
          wasn't worth the effort or losses due to the remote
          location. Finally, after the Battle of Yavin, the Mon
          Calamari openly and formally joined the Rebellion,
          one of the few worlds to openly do so. The system is
          now protected by Rebel starships, often coming right
          off Mon Calamari's own production lines.</p>

    <div class="card planet-text-card">
      <div class="card-body">
        <p class="card-text">Before embarking on interstellar exploration,
          the Mon Calamari and Quarren built
          an orbital ring of labs and construction facilities.
          From there, they designed and developed
          the starships and other equipment needed for
          exploration and potential colonization. The ring
          has since become an enormous facility with millions
          of designers, workers, and builders.</p>
        <p class="card-text">Mon Calamari ships, especially large and
          important ships, are typically built as pieces of
          art. While specific classes hold the same general
          shape and capabilities, every ship is customized
          and specialized according to the task
          and artistic whims of the builders.</p>
