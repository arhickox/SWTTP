      <div class="card-body">
        <p class="card-text">Hoth is an icy, frozen world with brutal 
          weather conditions at the best of times. The planet 
          is so remote and isolated that it doesn't appear on 
          many star charts. While this would appear to make 
          it a prime location for pirates, smugglers, and those 
          who don't wish to be found, the few who try don't 
          stay very long. Hoth's taxing conditions don't stop at 
          the edge of the atmosphere, either. Meteors originating from a nearby asteroid field regularly strike the 
          surface, posing a hazard to starships and potential 
          settlements alike.</p>
        <p class="card-text">Hoth's massive ice sheets cover most of the planet's surface, concealing an enormous ocean. Natural 
          tidal and geological pressures form spectacular landscapes of deep fissures, mountain-like ice formations, 
          and translucent white-blue canyons. The mix of physics, water, and cold produces unexpected geysers 
          that freeze into towering, icy columns and arches.</p>
        <p class="card-text">Surprisingly, life exists on this frozen ball of ice. 
          Fungal and algae growths in certain areas beneath 
          the ice provide a limited food source to some animal 
          lifeforms. Tauntauns live on the snowbound plains, 
          and herds rely on one another to find food and provide communal warmth. Not all life is so docile. Huge, 
          powerful bipedal creatures called wampas hunt virtually every other living thing that might make a good 
          meal. A wampa that finds a herd of tauntauns sheltering in a cave is in for a meal, fight, and stampede. 
          Among the few rumors and stories of Hoth are tales 
          of fire-breathing dragon creatures living in some of 
          the deeper ice fissures.</p>
        <p class="card-text">The Rebel Alliance has taken a recent interest in the 
          world as a possible location for a new hidden base. 
          If viable, the Rebels have much work to do to build a 
          base and adapt their equipment to the severe cold.</p>

      <div class="card-body">
        <h3 class="secondBlock">Hiding Out</h3>
        <p class="card-text">Pirates, smugglers, and fugitives occasionally use Hoth as a temporary hideout. The 
          remote conditions usually make any such stay 
          short-lived. There are no permanent settlements or outposts on the planet, and those 
          who know of the world find no economic value 
          in the ice, snow, or even the creatures they 
          find. Tauntauns make good mounts, and are 
          occasionally captured and exported, but are 
          difficult to build a successful business around.</p>
        <p class="card-text">Those who do find temporary shelter in the ice 
          usually bring their own living quarters. While 
          this is typically a starship, it might also be prefabricated structures set on the ice or hidden 
          within the caves. Such activity usually frightens 
          off more timid creatures, but small groups or 
          individuals wandering alone eventually attract 
          the attention of any wampa in the area. Wampas are always dangerous and may attack individually or in small packs.</p>
