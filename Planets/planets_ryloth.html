    <div class="card planet-text-card">
      <div class="card-body">
        <p class="card-text">For millennia, the Twi'leks of Ryloth have
          managed to navigate the gray areas of galactic law and
          structure their economy around two commodities for
          which there is always a demand; slavery and spice.
          Experts at negotiation, Twi'leks clan lords skirt anti-slavery legislation by indenturing lower caste Twi'leks
          through "free will" contracts, slavery in all but name.
          While such habits skirt galactic law, many otherwise
          law-abiding cultures are only too happy to turn a blind
          eye to this practice in order to obtain Twi'lek slaves. </p>
        <p class="card-text">Spice saved the Twi'leks from becoming a permanent
          underclass to other species. Thousands of years ago,
          vast deposits of ryll spice were discovered on Ryloth.
          Mined from blooms below the surface, ryll could be
          used as the active agent in both medicines and narcotics. Suddenly, Ryloth had another resource valuable to
          the galaxy. The clans exploited the spice themselves
          rather than outsourcing the labor. As a result, Twi'lek
          slaves became a much rarer commodity, and fetched
          higher prices without depleting Ryloth's population.</p>
        <p class="card-text">Visitors to the planet find it a world of harsh conditions. Much of the terrain is rocky
          and barren, blighted
          by Ryloth's sun. Tremendous heat storms roll across
          the surface without warning, allowing only the hardiest of creatures, like the armored lylek, to survive.
          The weather is more temperate around the equator,
          where most Twi'lek settlements are located, including the capital city of
          Lessu. Those Twi'leks who choose to live elsewhere find
          shelter either below-the surface or shielded behind mountain rock, in cavernous cities like Kala'uun and
          Roancu.</p>
        <p class="card-text">As Ryloth's economy is primarily based on exports
          there is little indigenous industry, and almost all technology is imported. However, the Twi'leks are not
          technophobes; they prefer to maintain their position in the
          galactic community through bargaining and trade.</p>
        <p class="card-text">As anti-alien prejudice grows in the galaxy, the
          Twi'leks, given their similarities to humans, manage to
          dilute its impact on Ryloth by ingratiating themselves
          with Imperial officials. One executive of Sienar Fleet
          Systems found himself visiting Ryloth so frequently he
          built corporate offices in Kala'uun's caves.</p>

      <div class="card-body">
        <h3 class="secondBlock">Ryll Spice</h3>
        <p class="card-text">Though weaker than glitterstim, ryll can still be 
          a dangerous and addictive substance, causing 
          hallucinations and memory loss. Both the Republic and the Empire placed restrictions on its use, 
          licensing it only to pharmaceutical companies 
          for the production of painkillers and anesthetics. 
          The Twi'lek clans claim they mine ryll for legally 
          approved entities, but that does not explain the 
          millions of shipments that go missing every year. 
          The clans keep the pharmaceutical companies 
          happy by either offering cut-rate prices or adding "a little extra" to the orders.
