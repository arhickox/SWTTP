    <p>Bom underground but with a yearning for the stars, most <b>Sullustans</b> find their way into space as pilots and
      astrogators. Affable, curious, and free-spirited, Sullustans are not fond of the Empire, and even less fond of the
      fact that the corporatocracy that runs their government from the offices of SoroSuub has sold their entire planet to
      the Imperial war machine.</p>

          <div class="card-body">
            <p>Despite their very distinctive features, Sullustans are genetically near-humans. Their skin is generally pink
              in tone, with very little body hair. Their height tends to fall within 1.0 to 1.8 meters. They have large,
              dark eyes; large, rounded ears; and notable flaps of skin that extend down from their cheeks and are called
              "dewflaps."
            </p>
            <p>Evolving on a volcanic planet with a thoroughly inhospitable surface, the Sullustans became subterranean beings
              who thrived in the caves and tunnels beneath Sullust's unstable outer crust. Their adaptations give them exceptional
              hearing, including the ability to determine distances and directions via audio cues. Their eyes are such that
              they can see up to twenty meters even in total darkness. Unfortunately, this means most Sullustans start to
              suffer serious corneal damage when exposed to natural light over extended periods of time.</p>
            <p>Another evolutionary adaptation enables all Sullustans to always know what direction they are going, regardless
              of conditions or lack of physical signs. This ability allows the species to navigate the complex warrens and
              tunnel networks they live in. For reasons not yet fully understood, this natural direction sense in any situation
              extends all the way to space travel, even including hyperspace navigation.</p>

            <p>Sullustans have a very clan-oriented culture, in which a single female has many male mates, and the group
              lives together and raises the children. Females grow to a certain maturity, after which they go on to find
              their own group of males with which to start another family group (called a "warren-clan"). The Sullustans
              have a polytheistic religion, and they revere death as the "Eternal Sleep." They maintain massive and elaborate
              vaults as holy sites, which are quite beautiful.</p>
            <p>Though most Sullustans stay close to home, those seeking adventure and new experiences found themselves able
              to parlay their natural sense of direction into lucrative jobs as spacers throughout the galaxy. These spacers
              learned a great deal, especially about technology and manufacturing, which they brought home with them to share
              with their people. Eventually, the extremely lucrative mining found on Sullust and its moons financed a huge
              boom in the Sullustese economy, which came to be dominated by the highly diversified SoroSuub Corporation.
              Employing over half the population, SoroSuub ultimately engineered circumstances allowing it to take over the
              government of the planet; at first, this was behind the scenes, but with the rise of the Empire, it became
              a legal fact as well.</p>
            <p>Sullustans are naturally friendly and outgoing, enjoying practical jokes as a way to see how others react.
              They are inherently curious, and many consider them reckless. They have a profound desire to experience the
              galaxy directly, in every way they can.</p>
