    <p>The secretive and isolationist <b>Kaminoans</b> saw the end of an ice age flood their planet, and their scientists
      turned to genetic manipulation to survive. Society changed rapidly as bioengineering became an integral part of their
      life. Not content with simply altering the genetics of native flora and fauna to prevent a mass extinction, the Kaminoans
      began to alter themselves.</p>
    <p>Kaminoans isolated genes for intelligence, strength, speed, grace, abstract thinking, linear thinking, sensory perception,
      and in some cases, aesthetics. They also developed a caste-like society based on genetic selection. Determining the
      caste focus of the next generation combined a complex mixture of societal pressure, personal preferences, economic
      considerations, and other current concerns.</p>
    <p>This concentration on genetic manipulation pulled their society further away from galactic interaction. Eventually,
      however, the Kaminoans saw a market for one of their skills: cloning. Their work attracted the attention of the Republic,
      and the Kaminoans turned all their efforts toward creating its Grand Army.</p>

            <p>Taller on average than humans, Kaminoans tend to be slender, with an elongated neck and oblong head. Descended
              from an aquatic species, they retain the flowing, graceful movements of their ancestors as well as the ability
              to see into the ultraviolet spectrum with their large eyes. Although Kaminoans seem to favor white as a design
              aesthetic, they are able to discern a vast range of patterns and colors that appear simply as white to other
              species.
            </p>
            <p>Unlike most species, Kaminoans utilize their knowledge of genetic engineering on themselves. Whether their
              current physical presentation is as much a product of that engineering as it is “natural” is a matter of some
              debate. Kaminoans enjoy an extended but healthy old age without the usual physical debility or mental degradation.
              Gender is considered an aesthetic choice, the only difference being that male Kaminoans sport a headcrest,
              while female Kaminoans do not.</p>

            <p>Kaminoans generally maintain an air of polite impassiveness. As a result, outsiders consider them emotionless
              and identical. It doesn’t help that Kaminoans choose similar clothing, although many impor￾tant individuals
              wear a large, pale collar around their neck. In reality, Kaminoans express a more relaxed emotional attitude
              with each other.</p>
            <p>As a genetically and socially engineered society, the Kaminoans remain isolationist and culturally naive.
              Their caste structure assigns each Kaminoan to a specific duty based on genetic and intellectual predisposition.
              Outliers do exist, and though they are not shunned, they tend to become curiosities as others try to determine
              how the deviation occurred.</p>

            <p>The thawing at the end of its last ice age dramatically changed <b>Kamino</b>. The world, now covered in a
              global ocean, suffers from constant storms and massive winds. Cities provide shelter from the wind, rain, and
              water, rising high above the ocean surface on stilted anchors. The cities harness electricity from the storms,
              while the warm ocean provides plenty of rich nutrients and biodiversity. Kaminoan trade in genetic samples
              means that several offworld creatures, such as the aiwha, now also live there.</p>
            <p>Of particular note is that many stellar databases don’t contain Kamino’s location, beyond the Outer Rim near
              the Rishi Maze. When they developed the cloning program for the Republic, the Kaminoans asked to have the location
              of their planet redacted to protect their privacy. Since the Clone Wars ended, that information has trickled
              back sporadically.</p>

              have joined the Alliance as engineers, biogeneticists, and physicians. Their amorality in medical matters and

            <p>Kaminoans are unusual in that widespread genetic engineering of their species is as much a part of life as
              it is a business. Outsiders can find their casual amorality over such things disturbing, whereas Kaminoans
              believe the practice to be as innocuous as weaving and as sublime as art. When Kaminoans develop a new genome
              and sell the pattern, they view it the same way they view writing a book and selling the copies.</p>
            <p>Currently, Kaminoan society has reached a crossroads. Do they bioengineer a generation more pliable and servile
              in order to work with the Empire, or do they alter their genetics toward independence and rebellion? In either
              case, the Galactic Civil War threatens to radically transform Kaminoan culture once more.</p>
