    <p>The <b>Quermian</b> species is an offshoot of the Xexto, produced through genetic tampering long ago by Arkanian scientists.
      Though larger than their Xexto cousins, Quermians tend to be less physically adept; they rarely make full use of their
      great height or the extended reach of their four arms. Most rely instead on the extensive mental processing power offered
      by their dual brains, which they use to read other species for their own benefit.</p>

          <div class="card-body">
            <p>The Quermians are a tall, spindly species, with slender torsos surrounded by six limbs—including two pairs
              of arms—and extended necks nearly as lengthy as the trunks from which they rise. Their skin tends toward a
              pale, ashen hue and is frequently wrinkled with slight folds. Their faces have only smooth skin where the nose
              is found on many other species; instead, olfactory organs on their hands perform the function of detecting
              scents.
            </p>
            <p>Like the Xexto, Quermians have two brains, one in their head and one in their chest. Unlike their cousins,
              who divide different functions between the two brains, Quermians each have two fully developed brains. In some
              Quermians, each of the two brains even develops its own separate personality. In Quermians who are controlled
              by a unified mind, the secondary brain operates in tandem with the first, processing input with a level of
              detail and insight that can seem uncanny to many other species. In particular, the dual brains of the Quermians
              allow them to read otherwise undetectable signals in the body language of any species. Quermians sometimes
              exploit this understanding to communicate silently through minute shifts in posture, allowing them to act in
              concert without any words being exchanged. The level of insight and communication Quermians are known to display
              has given them a strange reputation among other species, who sometimes suspect them of possessing further gifts,
              or even an innate Force sensitivity.</p>

            <p>Quermian society is largely focused inward, with a simple, communal lifestyle allows individuals to concentrate
              on their own needs. By the standards of most advanced societies, the Quermians consume very little. Many members
              of the species spend much of their time on intangible pursuits such as philosophy or the production of art,
              literature, and music. The nature of Quermian intuition and communication is such that members of their society
              who want for basic necessities are easy to identify, and swift aid is typically rendered to these individuals.
              Even the most selfish Quermians can rarely stomach reading the pain of their fellows for long.</p>
            <p>When in the company of sentients outside their species, Quermians often operate very differently. Their ability
              to read other species is not as sharp as their understanding of each other. However, it does offer them an
              edge in most social maneuvering, giving them something of a reputation as manipulators or hucksters. Certainly,
              some Quermians revel in their ability to so easily discern hidden motives and desires, although many simply
              use the talent to avoid being manipulated themselves.</p>

            <p>The ancestors of modern Quermians were named for <b>Quermia</b>, the world on which the Arkanians settled
              them. After the ancient Arkanians moved on, the Quermians developed their own society, centered on a largely
              peaceful communal lifestyle and the contemplation of philosophy. The long peace of Quermian society can at
              least partially be attributed to the ease with which the species is able to communicate and share its feelings
              and concerns.</p>
            <p>Of course, Quermia’s history is not entirely peaceful, although strife usually has came from outside influence
              rather than internal struggles. During the Clone Wars, Quermia was isolated from the Republic in Separatist
              space, and it suffered heavily under an extensive blockade. With the fall of the Separatist cause, the blockade
              was lifted, but Imperial rule is not usually considered a substantial improvement among the generally peaceful
              Quermians. Given the Empire’s propaganda campaign against the Jedi and its purges of Force users, some Quermians
              even fear that their frequently misunderstood talents might lead the Empire to take drastic measures against
              them.

            <p>Although the Quermians do not possess a more inherent affinity for the Force than do most other species, they

              Poof, who sat on the Jedi High Council until his death, shortly before the Clone Wars. Furthermore, their natural
              insight has led many outsiders to assume that all Quermians are Force-sensitive. In the current state of the
              galaxy under Emperor Palpatine, this assumption causes many problems for Quermians abroad across the galaxy,

            <p>Few species in the galaxy are as thoroughly misunderstood as the Quermians, who find that a quirk of their
              dual-brained biology leads the ignorant to assume that many or even all of them are Force-sensitive. The educated
              widely ridiculed this assumption during the days of the Republic, when the Jedi were widely known. In current
              times, however, Imperial misinformation campaigns have taken what was already a difficult reputation to live
              with and made it nearly unbearable.</p>
            <p>When interacting with other species, Quermians are now faced with an unenviable choice. They can make use
              of their natural talents, intuiting the crux of any conversation and resolving their business easily, or they
              can try to ignore their insights and behave as if they do not know as much as they truly do. Some Quermians
              who choose the latter path compare it to walking around a corner with their eyes shut, as their natural insight
              occurs on a level as basic to them as vision or any other sense. These Quermians who ignore their insights
              still have mixed success avoiding the stigma that has come to surround the species, as they are often perceived
              as distracted, inattentive, or even shifty. Quermians who manage to convince business partners or traveling
              companions of their normality are matched in number by those who find themselves pegged as conniving or eerie
              even as they try to avoid demonstrating any off-putting talents.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the only benefit in all of this is that truly Force-sensitive Quermians are harder to discern from
              their peers if they do not use overt Force powers. On worlds where the Imperial authorities have grown sick
              of responding to false alarms, careful Force-sensitives might be able to pass off their talents as just more
              inherent oddities of the species.</p>
