    <p>Although humans and Zabrak have
      been born, lived, and died on Dathomir, the truly
      unique <b>Dathomirians</b> are near-humans who practice
      a strange blend of magicks and alchemy—those
      who make up the clans known as the Nightsisters.
      Generations of genetic drift and exposure to the
      planet’s power from the dark side of the Force have
      created a distinct people and culture focused on self-determination, strength, and discipline. Other species
      consider the Dathomirians selfish, dangerous, and
      cruel. If the Dathomirians cared about the opinions of
      others, they would agree.</p>

            <p>Perhaps due to a genetic quirk or
              some subtle influence of the Force, the near-human
              Dathomirians are all women with pale white, blue, or
              gray skin with darker markings that the Nightsisters
              accentuate with tattooed patterns. They have piercing
              eyes that range in color from white to blue to amber,
              and their hair can be any shade: dark black or stark
              white, or any of the rainbow of colors in between.</p>
            <p>Every creature and being on Dathomir must
              have strength and stamina in order to survive the
              planet, and Dathomirians are no exception. A weak 
              Dathomirian is a dead Dathomirian. The Nightsisters
              further train for speed and mental fortitude, pushing
              an already-strong people toward developing a warrior’s endurance.</p>

            <p>Dathomir housed human exiles, criminals,
              and disenfranchised beings for generations, yet the
              Dathomirians have multiple stories about their origins—all contradictory. One commonly told story
              claims the Jedi Council exiled a woman named Aliya,
              who trained the women on Dathomir in the ways of
              the Force. The Council has no such record. At least one
              band of exiles survived on the vibrant yet violent planet. These proto-Dathomirians continued to explore
              the Force, applying their discoveries toward practical
              uses, creating the alchemy, magicks, and weapons
              they now employ.</p>
            <p>Over the generations since, these people—who
              began calling themselves Nightsisters—bonded with
              the human and Zabrak criminal exiles, absorbing their
              bitterness, harshness, and ire against the Republic.
              These misanthropic attitudes pushed the Nightsisters
              toward self-reliance and isolationism. They remain a
              matrilineal and female-only society; the male humans
              and Zabrak are never invited to join their clans.</p>
            <p>A few Dathomirians may have rejected the Nightsisters’ society and magicks, but they are few and far
              between and essentially live as hermits. A Dathomirian
              wishing to return to the Nightsisters need only prove
              her lineage through a genetic test, via a magickal ritual, or by revealing secret Nightsister knowledge. Once
              a Nightsister, always a Nightsister.</p>
            <p>Historically, the Dathomirians divided themselves
              by clans, each led by a Mother, who passed on her
              specific knowledge and wisdom orally or in written
              form. Dathomirian society contains quite a number of
              texts by these Mothers, sometimes based on a specific theme of wisdom, using shadows, light, law, or other
              metaphor to teach their lessons. The tomes blend history, spirituality, local knowledge, folklore, and insight.</p>

            <p><b>Dathomir</b>, a temperate and largely
              unexplored world in the Outer Rim’s Quelii sector,
              has a rich biomass and abundant natural resources.
              Due to its isolation from major hyperspace lanes,
              however, it remains largely uncharted. Lurking predators, strange flora and fauna, and rumors of baleful
              and supernatural activity are enough that many traders refuse to land on the planet, further increasing its
              isolation. While Dathomir has all the necessities to
              support intelligent life, it might seem as if the very
              environment harbors an ill will toward life and light.</p>
            <p>Throughout most of the galaxy’s history, people
              treated Dathomir as an exile’s planet. Supposedly,
              the Republic used the planet as an unofficial penal
              colony. It dropped prisoners onto Dathomir with no
              real support, a bare minimum of supplies, and the
              directive to turn the planet into a true colony. The
              records of these “colonists” conveniently do not exist
              in Republic databases, and history has largely forgotten the planet.</p>
            <p>Those with a sensitivity to the Force claim Dathomir
              to be a planet shrouded in deep shadow. The Nightsisters, if asked, merely claim Dathomir a locus of
              spiritual power. The few Jedi historians who know
              of the Nightsisters believe they have conjured the
              shroud themselves, not only as a shield from prying
              eyes, but also as a defiant warning to the Jedi Order,
              which allegedly exiled their founder.</p>
            <p>Some of the Nightsisters’ wisdom has come from
              their exploration of the many ancient ruins scattered
              across the planet. Most Nightsisters believe Dathomir
              hosted at least one empire in the ancient past, though
              this is unverified. Because of their practical nature,
              Dathomirians and Zabrak have repurposed some of
              these ancient ruins to their own use, turning them into
              temples with stone facades depicting revered Nightsisters and Zabrak.</p>

            <p>Dathomirians in general want
              to be left alone, but the Clone Wars, the meddling of
              the Sith, and the prying of Jedi all threaten to expose
              their planet and society. The Nightsisters, particularly
              spiritual leader Mother Talzin, have sent away members to collect intelligence, hone their skills against the
              vast diversity of the galaxy, and even earn a few credits.</p>
            <p>Dathomirians who journey out into the galaxy find
              that their philosophy of struggle and determination
              fits well in the Outer Rim. A life of isolation and hardship on Dathomir may be the perfect arena to test
              their strength, but the wider galaxy provides much
              more violence and many more enemies, allies, and
              opportunities.</p>
            <p>As the Nightsisters continue to grow in power and
              influence, they threaten to forgo their neutrality in
              matters regarding Sith and Jedi. Mother Talzin’s
              manipulations may bring Dathomir too far into the
              galactic limelight. Some Nightsisters chafe at the
              growing attention paid to their planet, their sanctuary.
              Others trust the leadership of Mother Talzin, pushing
              all Nightsisters to band under her. Some Nightsisters
              even talk about building their own Sith-like empire in

            <p>The Nightsisters definitively dominate society and politics on Dathomir. Their magicks
              give them undeniable power. In general, the
              generations of Republic exiles and Zabrak
              refugees avoid the Nightsisters as much as
              possible. Some Zabraks, in order to gain some
              control over their lives, have established a
              vassal-like relationship with the Nightsisters.
              Both groups share a similar philosophy. Life
              on Dathomir tends to give people the same
              practical, cold, and sometimes cruel outlook.</p>
            <p>The Nightsisters require the Nightbrothers
              to undergo brutal ritual trials. Nightbrothers who pass the trials are selected to serve
              the Nightsisters as muscle or by performing dangerous tasks. Any attempt to usurp
              the Nightsisters’ power results in swift and
              merciless retribution, so the Nightbrothers
              grudgingly give up a member of their own
              once in a while in exchange for protection
              from the other monsters of Dathomir.</p>
