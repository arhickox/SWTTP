      aristocratic and worker caste alike, face occupation
      and loss of sovereignty under the Republic flag.

          <div class="card-body">
            <p>A winged, insectoid species, Geonosians have a slim, humanoid build. Their chitinous skin
              ranges from red or orange to green or blue in hue, and
              their limbs have additional joints compared to most
              humanoids. Depending on a Geonosian’s caste, their
              wings may be vestigial or fully functional. Beyond
              this general form, the height, look, and structure of
              individual Geonosians varies. Compared to most sentients, Geonosians don’t live long—with an average
              lifespan of sixty-five years—and they mature quickly.</p>
            <p>Geonosian hives welcome physiological differences
              insofar as they might benefit the hive. By modifying genetics, either through intentional engineering
              or selective breeding, hives produce a wide variety
              of near-subspecies among their worker and warrior
              castes. These modification experiments, however,
              remain haphazard and prone to the whims of the aristocratic caste.</p>

            <p>Geonosian society centers around their
              queens, their hives, and the castes within those hives.
              Offworlders generally don’t realize that Geonosians
              have a queen, and even fewer realize that they have
              multiple queens, sometimes many within a single
              hive. In some hives, the queen simply produces offspring, and the aristocratic caste rules. In other
              hives,
              the queen acts behind the scenes, manipulating the
              squabbling aristocrats’ desire for power. In still other
              hives, the queen rules directly.</p>
            <p>Historically, the hives of Geonosis have fought
              each other for resources, territory, sport, and political power. When the Geonosians began trading with
              offworlders, this competition was channeled into economic and industrial—and sometimes open—warfare.
              The warrior caste bears the brunt of the fighting,
              though the survivors receive promises of promotion.
              Often, warriors also serve as police, protecting, but
              more often suppressing, their own hive.</p>
            <p>With a worker caste whose members function as
              slaves, Geonosian hives can produce an incredible
              quantity of industrial goods, even changing their
              production focus within days. This dependence on
              an oppressed caste, along with the planet’s remote
              location in the Outer Rim, has kept Geonosis from
              receiving official representation in the Galactic Republic. Many citizens of the Republic have no idea
              thattheir droids and other goods were built via Geonosian worker caste labor.</p>
            <p>Throughout Geonosian history, the worker caste
              has repeatedly revolted against the oppression of the
              aristocracy. The warriors inevitably have countered
              with quick and bloody suppression. When the warriors of a hive revolt, the hive’s aristocrats have been
              known to negotiate with other hives for reinforcements to quell their own populace.

            <p><b>Geonosis</b> lies in the Arkanis sector of the
              Outer Rim, near Tatooine. Its sun’s heat and radiation
              blasts the land, and massive sandstorms scour the
              harsh desert planet. Large, hollowed-out hive colonies in giant spires dot the landscape and offer respite
              from the radiation and heat. Tunnels worm through
              the planet, connecting hives and providing additional
              space for expansion or waging inter-hive warfare.</p>
            <p>Geonosis has fifteen moons, whose gravitational
              pull causes the volcanic activity on the planet. It
              also has a giant ring system, which formed recently
              enough—in terms of eons—that the Geonosians have
              myths describing an angry universe destroying a
              moon to teach a weak species a lesson on survival.</p>
            <p>Because Geonosis lies outside Republic space, the
              Republic—including the Jedi—had no official standing to investigate the world in the years leading up
              to the Clone Wars. Even had the Republic been aware
              of what was transpiring on Geonosis, it had no legal
              justification for enforcing regulations or otherwise
              interfering in the massive arms buildup the Geonosians were undertaking at the behest of planets and
              corporations that would soon secede.</p>

            <p>Offworlders know Geonosian Hive-Mind as
              a spoken language with clicks and low, guttural notes.
              Offworlders can learn how to speak it, but Geonosians also employ a full range of touches, pheromones,
              and body motions to communicate. This explains why
              some Geonosians come away from offworlder conversations with a completely different perception of what
              has transpired, and it also explains how some Geonosians can communicate as if by telepathy.</p>
            <p>On Geonosis, some members of the aristocratic
              caste learn to understand and even speak Basic.
              Regardless of caste, Geonosians who venture out into
              the galaxy may eventually learn Basic, though they
              rarely speak it. With this simpler language, Geonosians do not face the same kinds of miscommunications

            <p>While Geonosis was the
              primary producer of droids for the Separatists’ droid
              army, its loyalty sat firmly with the Confederacy of
              Independent Systems. For the lower castes, life
              became more brutal and oppressive. For the upper
              castes, their wealth and influence only increased.
              After the Second Battle of Geonosis, however, the
              planet comes under Republic control and occupation.</p>
            <p>The Republic remains less concerned with governance and more with occupation to keep the planet
              away from Separatist hands. Some hives eagerly aid
              the Republic in order to gain power in the new regime.
              Other hives go into hiding, hoping for this conflict to
              pass. A few plan insurrection, but only if they believe
              they can come out on top.</p>
            <p>Most citizens of the Republic associate the droid
              army with the public face of the Separatist Alliance,
              but few know what species constructed them. As a
