    <p>A balanced and serene species, <b>Chagrians</b> are peaceful and stoic. They hail from a wealthy planet, and few native
      Chagrians have wanted for life’s basic necessities—or even many of its luxuries. As such, Chagrians are rarely greedy
      or avaricious, and their desires are seldom motivated by such basic needs. Additionally, Chagrians are sticklers for
      procedure and law, and they are unwilling to deviate from the legal and bureaucratic systems they are accustomed to.
      Such predilections ensure that Chagrians make excellent Soldiers, Commanders, and Diplomats.</p>

            <p>Chagrians begin their lives in an immature tadpole form some thirty centimeters in length. Born in clutches
              of two or three siblings, they are cared for by their parents in sealed tubs kept within the home. As they
              mature, Chagrian children develop arms, legs, and lungs that allow them to breathe air. Once their limbs are
              fully developed, young Chagrians leave the water, and the last vestiges of their intermediate physiology begin
              to fade away. Adult Chagrians are humanoid and stand two meters tall on average. They possess powerful, muscular
              bodies well suited to swimming and heavy labor. As a result of their homeworld’s exposure to an unstable sun
              during their species’ evolution, Chagrian skin runs the gamut from light blue to cerulean to indigo, and it
              provides them with an innate resistance to harmful radiation. Though their planet’s sun has been stable for
              millennia, this radiation resistance has become a dominant trait of their species.</p>
            <p>Chagrians possess elegant horns growing down from the sides of their heads. Males possess a second set atop
              their skulls, called lethorns. Once used during mating rituals, the horns were also employed as weapons during
              formal duels. Though duels for mates have since been outlawed, Chagrians, especially males, consider their
              horns a sign of status. A large portion of Chagrian daily personal ritual consists of caring for their horns,
              filing and decorating them in an otherwise uncharacteristic display of vanity.</p>
            <p>Despite having air-breathing lungs, Chagrians are as comfortable below the waves of their planet as they are
              above them. They are excellent swimmers, and their eyes have developed to help them see in dim, subaquatic
              light. Able to breathe underwater as well, Chagrians can remain submerged for months or years at a time without
              suffering any ill effects. They adapt easily to the seas of other planets as long as the alien ocean’s chemistry
              is similar to that of their own planet.</p>
            <p>Because of their constant exposure to the salty oceans of their planet, Chagrians can taste little else but
              salt. As a result, their sense of taste is incredibly weak, and they obtain little pleasure from eating. Rather
              than tasting food, Chagrian tongues act to enhance their sense of smell, much as those of some reptilian species.
              As such, they can often be seen briefly flicking their tongues out when assessing the viability of unfamiliar
              food or drink.</p>

            <p>Chagrian society is law abiding and peaceful. Justice, both legal and social, is valued above all other things,
              and Chagrian courts are some of the most fair and balanced in the galaxy. Both criminal and civil investigations
              are meticulous and thorough, and even the most innocuous forms of evidence are carefully studied. Even those
              Chagrians put on trial are all too willing to admit their guilt, and only the most craven Chagrians deny the
              charges brought against them if they are true. This ensures that most criminal trials are brief affairs with
              little, if any, fanfare.</p>
            <p>Given their homeworld’s focus on tourism, Chagrians are accommodating and obedient—sometimes to a fault. Despite
              this desire to please others, Chagrians aren’t ignorant of cruelty or bias. In fact, their affluent culture
              allows them to take notice of social injustices more quickly than other, less privileged species, who might
              otherwise consider such inequity to be normal.</p>
            <p>Because of the richness of their homeworld and the amenities enjoyed by their people—such as excellent medical
              care, higher education, and social equality—Chagrians rarely want for anything. As a result, they are easily
              disturbed by concepts such as prejudice, homelessness, disease, and starvation, especially when confronted
              with them on other worlds. Many Chagrians are so moved by such sights that they seek to remedy them, whether
              through charity, by taking direct action, or by using local law to initiate lasting change.</p>
            <p>Due to their species’ weak sense of taste, Chagrians consider meals to be an inconvenience at best. As a result,
              most Chagrians carry nutritional supplements or food capsules in an effort to shorten the time they spend eating.
              The concept of celebratory banquets is largely unheard of outside of Champala’s opulent resorts and hotels,
              and offworld chefs are hired at great expense to satisfy the refined palates of tourists and visitors.</p>
            <p>Chagrians in positions of authority—including those in command of Rebel military units—go to great lengths
              to see to the well-being of their subordinates. As long as supply lines remain open and logistics are competently
              managed, a unit commanded by a Chagrian officer is sure to be well fed, properly equipped, and highly motivated.
              Unfortunately, such officers are often unwilling to lose the lives of their troops, even when such sacrifice
              is called for.</p>

            <p><b>Champala</b> is a watery world featuring dramatic tides and beautiful coastlines. Chagrian settlements
              are built within the tidal zones of Champala’s coastlines, and as the tides ebb and flow, these communities
              are engulfed by the rising sea. Chagrians, given their amphibious nature, are unimpeded by such events, which
              are as common and expected as the sun and seasons. The only Chagrian-built structures designed to remain above
              the rising tides are the planet’s spaceports, including the one in Champala’s capital city of Tidros.</p>
            <p>The majority of the Chagrian economy centers on tourism. Champala has always been a popular resort destination
              for affluent travelers from the Core Worlds and beyond. The planet’s warm climate, pristine beaches, and friendly
              denizens once attracted millions of visitors every year. Unfortunately, the Chagrian choice to support the
              Rebel Alliance, as well as the Empire’s subsequent occupation of Champala, has caused the tourism industry
              to dwindle exponentially.</p>
            <p>The Empire has expanded Champala’s mining and manufacturing operations tenfold, resulting in its once-pristine
              seas’ becoming poisoned by industrial pollution. The Chagrian people shoulder the burden of the Imperial occupation
              with their typical stoicism, torn between their desire for freedom and their unwillingness to see their society

              liberation of many water worlds— including Mon Cala—from the Empire’s tyranny.</p>
            <p>Due to their penchant for adhering to the rule of law, including military code, Chagrians make excellent Commanders.

            <p>Though Chagrians are not, by nature, a warlike species, their history is occasionally punctuated by bouts
              of conflict and unrest. To ancient Chagrians, war was a heavily officiated rarity that adhered to countless
              rules and codes. One such code involves the so-called “color of war,” a shade of red that is to be worn by
              combatants only during wartime. As a result, any Chagrian wearing that shade is considered to be a combatant
              during wartime, and thus is a valid target during any military action.</p>
            <p>Due to this tradition, Chagrian soldiers fighting the Empire as part of the Rebel Alliance often incorporate
              red accoutrements as part of their standard uniforms. Such accoutrements usually take the form of epaulets,
              uniform piping, combat webbing, or some combination of the three. Not only does this promote solidarity between
              Chagrian soldiers, but it also provides a visual cue as to an individual Chagrian’s commitment to the Rebel
              cause.
