    <p><b>Ewoks</b> are small, fur-covered,
      ursine beings who inhabit the forest
      moon of Endor, an Outer Rim world
      circling a gas giant system near the
      area of the galaxy known as the
      Unknown Regions. While Imperial
      propaganda depicted them as having been wiped out after the Battle
      of Endor, the intelligent, primitive
      Ewoks still live in sizable communities
      in their wooded home, a lush environment alive with thick vegetation
      and myriad forms of wildlife. The
      world’s low axial tilt and its regular
      orbit around the gas giant create a
      temperate climate for most of the
      moon, and three-hundred-meter tall trees cover many regions and
      are central to the landscape. For
      this reason, they are significant to
      Ewok culture and religion.</p>

            <p>Though Ewoks suffer from limited eyesight, these small creatures have an excellent sense of
              smell that more than compensates. They are accomplished
              hunters, and, being omnivores,
              they also gather food from
              the plants that surround them.
              In some cases they have been
              known to mistakenly eat sentient
              beings, assuming they were simply large game to be captured.
              However, they can usually
              be convinced to put away
              their cooking implements
              after some conversation and a little bit of luck.</p>
            <p>While they forage and
              hunt, Ewoks are extremely
              alert and easily startled.
              Many carnivorous creatures
              inhabit the forest moon, and
              thus Ewoks are always prepared for an attack. Some
              researchers have noted
              that they seem to possess
              a “sixth sense”—the ability to perceive threats
              to their community far
              in advance. It has been likened to some Jedi Force talents, although only a
              few Ewoks have shown the ability to truly manipulate this
              mysterious power.</p>

            <p>Ewoks are curious, good-natured creatures who value com- and
              munity, family, and friendship. Their culture is gender-based,
              with the males serving as hunters, warriors, chieftains, and
              shamans, and the females acting as gatherers and domestics,
              rearing and educating their young. Music and dancing are part
              of everyday life; in fact, Ewoks use music to communicate
              with other villages via rhythmic drumbeats. As news echoes fam
              through the ancient trees, it imbues their environment with an aura of extra life.</p>
            <p>Though their culture is rich in historic lore,
              art, and music, Ewoks are primitive, wearing
              only hoods adorned with bones and feathers
              for decoration and to indicate status in the
              community. They learn quickly, however, and
              when exposed to technology, they will figure
              it out easily—sometimes after an initial bout
              of jitters and mistakes. Few have yet ventured
              into space, and when they do it is typically by
              tagging along with star pilots or crews that
              visit their planet. Among these few are a select
              number who have learned modern technology
              enough to be useful on space crews.</p>
            <p>Ewoks have developed no technology of
              their own beyond standard woodworking
              tools and rudimentary weapons. But they possess a flair for invention with their primitive
              resources—creating traps and snares that can
              be highly effective even against great technological threats. Their ingenuity was key to the
              Rebel Alliance’s defeat of the Empire at the
              Battle of Endor, and if given leave to explore
              and learn the ways of technology, they will frequently become adept.</p>

              The Forest Moon has lighter-than-standard gravity and an ecosystem bursting with life, including three native sentient species. The Forest
              Moon is also home to castaways: Local space is plagued by hyperspace anomalies that have wrecked starships from nearby Sanyassa and

          <div class="card-body">
            <p>The Ewok people are suspicious and cautious, yet fierce
              fighters, brave and loyal to their tribe. This is also evidenced
              in their religion, which emphasizes the importance of home,
              family, and the trees surrounding them. A new tree is planted for each Ewok at birth, and is considered
              that being’s “life tree.” Ewoks believe that their spirits
              pass into these trees when they die. Moreover,
              Ewoks regard these trees as their guardians,
              and in times of crisis, the tribal leaders will commune with the oldest and wisest trees, seeking
              guidance. The trees, they believe, are intelligent,
              long-lived beings who watch over them, and in
              a reciprocal manner they must safeguard the
              trees. This belief was one of the main reasons
              that they aided the Rebels in their fight against the Empire, as they felt that the Empire posed
              threat to every aspect of their environment.</p>
            <p>War is not common among the Ewoks, however. Although they exist in tribes and remain
              fiercely loyal to them, Ewoks will greet other
              tribes with warmth and goodwill, as long as
              they act with honor and respect. They will even
              accept outsiders into their tribe if the visitors
              demonstrate a familial loyalty to them (if the
              strangers haven’t already been mistaken for
              dinner). Although as skilled at building weaponry as they are at constructing their elaborate
              villages, arms are mainly kept handy to defend
              against outside threats, rather than against one another.</p>
            <p>Because religion is so important to Ewok society, the village shaman governs a tribe side by
              side with the ruling chieftain. The shaman interprets signs to
              guide the chieftain in his decisions, and their belief system
              includes references to a living energy similar to the Force
              that feeds the trees and likewise strengthens and guides the
              Ewoks.</p>
