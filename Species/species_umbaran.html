    <p>The <b>Umbaran</b> people have had a contentious history
      with the Galactic Republic. Members of the Republic
      since its founding, they have a long tradition of participating in galactic politics. Never afraid to break away
      from the majority, however, they have always prioritized Umbara over the Republic. Umbarans’ political
      history has caused many other species to consider
      them mysterious, deceitful, conniving, and untrustworthy, and to call them “the Shadow People” behind
      their back. Some believe Umbarans have powers to
      control others’ minds, and beings of most species
      admit to feeling unsettled in their presence.</p>

            <p>Umbarans are near-humans with pale
              skin that has a faint tint of blue or purple to it. They
              naturally have pale hair, but Umbaran custom is to
              shave the head bald. Their eyes tend to have white
              or pale irises, again with a faint tint of color, usually
              gray or blue. Umbarans can see into the ultraviolet
              end of the spectrum and have adapted to low-light
              conditions, yet they are not greatly uncomfortable in
              bright artificial light.</p>
            <p>Prolonged exposure to sunlight, however, causes
              Umbarans to suffer irritability and short-term memory loss, similar to sleep deprivation in humans. Several
              hours in complete darkness usually resets their physiology. Bioluminescent lights do not affect Umbarans
              this way, and sunlight screened through transparisteel
              doesn’t affect them as harshly as raw sunlight.</p>

            <p>The Umbaran caste system is often believed
              to be rigid and complicated by outsiders, but their
              society actually allows a remarkable amount of social
              mobility. Still, Umbarans can fall more easily than they
              can rise. This system has more than a hundred tiers
              and titles, and families can shift their social status
              with enough popular support, political maneuvering, wealth, influence, or even through marriage. Of
              course, more nefarious methods, such as blackmail, assassination, and bribery, have been known to occur.
              Some Umbaran sociologists and historians believe
              that this porousness in the social structure means
              that in a few hundred years, references to the caste
              system will disappear altogether. Although caste titles
              and names still appear in legal documents, no one
              truly follows or enforces them. However, an ambitious
              Umbaran might not be above using a caste title as an
              insult or in sycophantic praise.</p>
            <p>This kind of culture might explain the Umbarans’
              attitude toward galactic politics. A change in position
              isn’t a betrayal, but merely a decision to better one’s
              status. A fall in power isn’t a disaster, but a setback to
              recover from. And a political victory isn’t the time to
              celebrate, but rather serves as an incentive to keep
              pushing, for one never knows when one’s fortunes are
              about to turn.</p>

            <p><b>Umbara</b> lies in the Ghost Nebula of the
              Expansion Region. Shrouded in clouds and perpetual
              night, the planet’s surface receives no light from its
              sun, and the nebula’s gases and dust envelop the
              entire system.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, Umbara teems with countless types
              of flora and fauna—including plenty of the large and
              hostile variety. Quite a few of the world’s plants and
              animals possess a form of chemical luminescence, a
              common evolutionary adaptation to either attract the
              attention of prey or scare off predators. For some species, this luminescence produces enough light for a
              creature to see its surroundings.</p>

            <p>Umbaran, also called Umbarese, is the
              spoken and written language of the Umbarans. In the
              written language, each number and letter is inscribed
              within a closed circle, and punctuation within half-circles. Most Umbarans also learn Basic as a matter
              of course.</p>
            <p>In a remnant of the baroque caste system, various
              social groups give certain common words slightly different pronunciations. Even the written language has
              minor variations that add serifs or tiny line strokes,
              or rotate letters a few degrees. Offworlders generally
              don’t perceive these differences, but astute Umbarans and those obsessed with lineage can identify the
              speaker’s or writer’s caste relatively quickly.</p>

          <div class="card-body">
            <p>Umbara has been a
              staunchly loyalist world from the beginning of the
              Clone Wars. Senator Mee Deechi aggressively advocated for increased military spending in the face of the
              Separatist threat, and is harshly critical of Senators
              in the pacifist faction, who seek a peaceful resolution
              to the conflict. According to him, a stance that supports any form of acquiescence to the Separatists’
              demands is unpatriotic at best.</p>
            <p>Umbara’s commitment to the Republic may stem
              from the similarities between the Umbaran culture
              of political subterfuge and unchecked ambition and
              what many others consider to be the worst aspects of
              corruption in the Republic. Umbara’s government has
              mastered the necessary bribery, blackmail, and other soft negotiation tactics that have become increasingly
              common in galactic politics. Umbara’s advanced technological base has given the world great influence in
              the Republic and fostered a strong economy.</p>
            <p>Umbarans who travel offworld face some discrimination. The Umbaran reputation for deceit predisposes
              many beings toward having a negative view of them.
              Many species find the appearance and mannerisms of
              Umbarans to be somewhat sinister, further strengthening such sentiments. By and large, however, most
              Umbarans who travel off world are more than savvy
              enough to overcome such preconceptions and succeed in matters both business and political—even if
              that does require some liberties with the truth.</p>

            <p>In a recent technological innovation, Umbaran soldiers on their homeworld wear suits
              filled with a pressurized green gas. Ship and
              tank pilots sit in cockpits filled with the same
              substance. This gas provides various breathable compounds that reduce panic and fear
              responses as well as improving cognitive
              focus. It increases Umbarans’ adrenaline
              while suppressing other symptoms of anxiety
              such as increased heart rate, rapid breathing,
              and jitteriness. The pressure both improves
              the gas exchange rate in the lungs and serves
              as a mild shock buffer to absorb impacts and
              kinetic projectiles. So far, field tests have
              proven the pressurized gas effective.</p>
