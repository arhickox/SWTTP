            <p> The Falleen are alluring reptilian humanoids with skin of supple scales in tones ranging from deep green
              to a dull gray-green hue. Flowever, Falleen can temporarily change their skin color at will to shades of orange
              or red when they exude potent pheromones to attract mates. The scales of their lithe, contoured physiques stiffen
              along their backs, where sharp ridges run down their spines. Female Falleen exhibit muted skin tones and less-defined
              spinal ridges compared to males, and their ability to modify their skin pigmentation is less pronounced.</p>
            <p>The exotic features of the Falleen make them among the most universally attractive beings in the galaxy, and
              their grooming and the use of their pheromones only enhance this view. Flowing, silky black hair accentuates
              their etched cheekbones and chiseled facial features. The males typically wear their hair in a single long
              topknot or braid, while the females favor setting their flowing locks into elaborate styles adorned with beads
              and decorative combs. The talons on their fingers and toes remain manicured yet simple.</p>

            <p>The Falleen species shares its name with its homeworld, which some say is as a tribute to its arrogance. Several
              feudal kingdoms rule over lower classes of artisans, laborers, slaves, and technicians. The ruling noble houses
              peacefully conduct business and political negotiations on behalf of their world while administering domestic
              corporations and private interests. While minor infighting between kingdoms occurs, Falleen nobles choose scheming
              and political maneuvering as their weapons in place of outright war</p>
            <p>Falleen value careful planning and reason, believing emotion is the natural enemy to a clear and intelligent
              mind. They consider displays of emotion taboo, and go to great lengths to control any outward emotional indicators.
              Through intense training and meditation, Falleen learn to rein in their emotions, control the color of their
              skin, and hone the use of pheromones to enthrall others. Falleen see species unable to control their emotions
              as inferior, and usually take little interest in their affairs—though many do enjoy the art of other, more
              expressive species</p>
            <p>While the technology of their civilization allows them to travel to other worlds, most Falleen commoners never
              leave their planet. The lower social classes work diligently to maintain their planet’s selfsufficiency in
              order to keep from relying on lesser species elsewhere in the galaxy. Instead, the Falleen opt to isolate their
              society from outside influences. The sale of Falleen slaves to offworlders is one of the rare exceptions to
              this cultural norm.</p>
            <p>As a rite of passage, young Falleen nobles embark on a pilgrimage around the known galaxy to behold its many
              spectacles and learn how to harness their abilities. When the pilgrims return from their journey, most use
              what they have learned to better govern the territories they inherit. Flowever, some pilgrims decide to remain
              offworld to make their mark on the galaxy.</p>

            <p>The planet <b>Falleen</b> rests in a pocket of space in the Mid Rim off the Corellian Run called the Doldur
              sector, and in some small way, Falleen has been a part of the greater galactic community for nearly four thousand
              years. The expansive rain forests, sprawling plains, and snowy mountains of Falleen remain unmolested over
              most of the planet thanks to modest urban sectors reserved for industry. Industrial zones like the polluted
              Yellow District in the capital city of Throne are common within every kingdom. This efficient production allows
              the population of over 520 million inhabitants to remain self-sufficient. After joining the Republic, the Falleen
              nobility opened their world to galactic commerce and offered their manufacturing districts to offworld corporations.</p>
            <p>Since the Empire’s rise to power, Imperial research and development facilities monopolize Falleen’s industrial
              sectors. Eisen Kerioth, Moff of the Doldur sector, distrusts the Falleen due to their ability to manipulate
              others, and he keeps a watchful eye on the planet. To minimize Falleen influence on the rest of the galaxy,
              and to monitor the Empire’s interests on their world, Kerioth maintains a blockade around the planet. Throne’s
              stellar-class starport, once open to offworld traders importing artwork and exotic fruits, now allows only
              Imperial traffic and Falleen nobility on pilgrimage. As a result, multiple shadowports operate around the planet,
              exporting slaves and smuggling in offworld luxuries.</p>

              to serve offworlders as slaves, or to communicate with other species while on their pilgrimage. Flowever, Falleen
              believe that, like all other things, the offworlders’ language is inferior to their own. The lack of inflection
              and emphasis in the Falleen language is indicative of their stoic culture and makes it easy for other species
              to learn.</p>
            <p>However, the use of skin coloration and phero­mones to replace the absent modulation makes it impossible for
              non-Falleen, even droid translators, to master their language. The fact that only Falleen can fully grasp the
              intricacies of their language serves to reinforce the elitist stance that Falleen stand above all other species.</p>

              of the Black Sun syndicate, which operated out of Mustafar during the Clone Wars. Falleen on the fringe might
              be connected to these powerful individuals—perhaps having fallen from grace as rising members of the syndicate—or
              they might be honest members of society who wish to be free of the criminal associations many sentients hold
              about their species. Regardless of their backgrounds, however, many Falleen press their innate advantage, using
              their manipulative abilities on unsuspecting sentient beings in order to attain lofty positions and wealth
              with ease.
            </p>
            <p>Several atrocities that have occurred on Falleen at the Empire’s hands have bred an intense disdain for the
              Emperor and his regime within the non-ruling Falleen classes. A handful of Rebel cells, operating out of Silver

              assumed it was no different from one of the countless retooling phases or corporate restructurings they had
              seen in the past. When the noble houses stopped receiving dividends from company shares and rent for the facilities
              ran within their kingdoms, they grew outraged. Next, when the blockade formed over their planet to prevent
              all incoming and outgoing traffic, the kings said the Empire had gone too far, but they were unaware of how
              much worse things would become.</p>
            <p>In the wake of the burgeoning conflict, some Falleen have fled their planet, while others have turned to the
