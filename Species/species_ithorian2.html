    <p>In Basic, <b>Ithorians</b> are called Hammerheads (though the nickname is not to their liking), as they possess one
      of the most unique head structures of any known biped. Ithorians are often considered the caretakers of the galaxy,
      so profound is their love of natural environments of all kinds and their desire to repair the damage sentient beings
      do to their worlds.

            <p>Ithorians have long, spindly bodies (ranging from 1.8 to 2.3 meters in height) and long fingers. At the top
              of an Ithorian's torso, the neck and head emerge as a continuous, curved structure that reaches forward and
              ends with a vaguely "T"-shaped protrusion. The Ithorian's eyes are large, inset orbs on either end of the structure's
              "T." Back near where the neck emerges from the torso, there is a mouth on either side. With four throats and
              these two mouths, Ithorians have the capacity to speak and sing in stereo. They possess powerful sonic abilities
              that can, with effort, be used offensively.</p>
            <p>Males and females are primarily distinguished by the humps on the backs of their heads; one for a male, two
              for a female. Their young, called "pupae," are spawned by the thousands from a single male. At this early stage,
              Ithorians have no limbs, moving around by use of locomotion tubes. All of this changes after their metamorphosis
              into young adults.</p>

            <p>Ithorian society is one based on a spiritual connection to "Mother Jungle," which is how they refer to the
              spirit of their lush, rainforest-covered planet of Ithor. The entire civilization is dedicated to never desecrating
              the planet; as soon as they had access to repulsorlift technology, the Ithorians built giant floating communities—called
              herdships—that allow them to float above and travel across their planet while minimizing their impact on its
              pristine beauty.</p>
            <p>Ithorians have carried this collective mentality with them out into the stars, adapting their herdship concept
              to interstellar travel. Each such herd, as they refer to their social groupings and extended families, is led
              by a Force-sensitive priest. This makes them anathema to Emperor Palpatine and his Empire. The only reason
              the planet has remained relatively untouched is due to the Empire's extortion of agricultural technology and
              other secrets from the Ithorians in return for abstaining from destroying the planetary surface.</p>
            <p>Ithorians are even more pacifistic than Gran, as a general rule; they intentionally weed out aggressive members
              of their species by exiling them from Ithor (which is why many people have their first encounter with atypically
              violent or ill-tempered Ithorians). Usually eschewing weapons, an Ithorian typically defends himself with his
              sonic bellow abilities. Ithorians out among the stars seek roles as artists, traders, and environmentalists.
              In this latter role, many Ithorians have acted to help restore ecological devastation done to other planets,
              usually as the result of one war or another.</p>

            <p>Much as with Gran, Ithorians are incredibly rare to find in the actual ranks of the Rebellion. Most Ithorians
              sympathize with the Alliance, yet their focus on life and the repairing of damage from violence makes them
              ill-suited for combat. Nonetheless, there are a handful of Ithorians who choose to fight a force willing to
              cause untold destruction to their world and so many others, believing this is how they can best serve "Mother
              Jungle." The Medic specialization of the Soldier career is a natural fit for an Ithorian, and the Diplomat
              career path is a good fit for one as well. Some Ithorians also find a role with the Scientist specialization
              of the Engineer career. The natural connection the species has to the Force makes the Force- Sensitive Emergent
              specialization an interesting choice as well. Unsurprisingly, the Personnel Duty is the most likely one for
              most Ithorians, though Resource Acquisition is also a worthy goal.</p>
