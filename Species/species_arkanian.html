    <p>Cold, calculating, and absolutely certain of their natural superiority to other species in the galaxy, the white-haired
      <b>Arkanians</b> are recognized across countless star systems for both their advanced bioengineering and their massive
      egos. This near-human species has been a part of galactic society for thousands of years and in that time has elevated
      genetic engineering from a science to an art form. Countless centuries of medical experimentation and efforts to stay
      on the cutting edge of biotechnology led the Arkanians to develop laboratory-created genetic offshoots of their own
      people; they regard these offshoots as lesser shadows of themselves or even slaves. Arkanians do not see themselves
      as brutal or ruthless because of this. They believe they are simply a pragmatic society, doing what is necessary to
      build upon generations of scientific knowledge in an effort to achieve absolute genetic perfection.</p>

            <p>Arkanians resemble humans in most respects, save for their pale white eyes and fingers that end in clawlike
              nails of the same coloring. Both of these features are a point of pride to Arkanians, who see them as signs
              of genetic purity. Arkanians are tall and lean, with chiseled features and well-defined muscles. Hair color
              varies, with white being the most common. Arkanians are long-lived compared to humans; most live for at least
              a century and spend over fifty years of their life in a state of prime health. This is seen as further proof
              of both their inherent superiority and their mastery of genetic science. Arkanians have keen vision and are
              capable of seeing into the infrared spectrum, though this has led to visual sensitivity that requires them
              to wear polarized lenses or blinders in certain environments.</p>
            <p>Arkanian Offshoots are bred in great variety as living experiments, though such beings are not regarded as
              “true Arkanians.” They typically live a brief life of servitude to their pure-blooded masters, with no hope
              of being regarded as anything more than a slave or pet.</p>

              addition to maintaining physical perfection, Arkanians are expected to have sharp, logical minds. Most Arkanians
              are well versed in academic and scientific matters, with a particular focus in medicine and genetics. Perhaps
              due to their natural arrogance, Arkanians expect subservience and respect from outsiders. Non-Arkanians need

            <p>A vast, icy tundra covers most of the Arkanian homeworld of <b>Arkania</b>. Ceaseless howling winds buffet
              the surface, making life upon it almost impossible. Instead, Arkanians live deep underground in vast networks
              of tunnels and caves. Heat is drawn from the planet’s core and filtered through these caverns, which provide
              all the modern amenities to those Arkanians worthy enough to receive them. Vast mines supply beautiful and
              valuable diamonds, sought by wealthy nobles and aristocrats from across the galaxy. These mines are tended
              to by Arkanian Offshoots and other lesser beings, while pure Arkanians tend to matters of scientific advancement.</p>
            <p>There are a handful of surface settlements on Arkania, though they are enclosed to seal out environmental
              hazards. Many of these cities host the great estates of particularly wealthy Arkanian diamond traders, as well

            <p>Arkanians who show strength in the Force often take an analytical view of the matter, seeking to investigate
              and experiment with it in order to achieve a perfect understanding. The Jedi Order had a surprising number
              of Arkanian Knights and Masters before its fall, many of whom slowly came to realize that the perfection of
              life lay not in science alone, but in understanding of the Force and compassion alongside more concrete observations.
              This led many Force-sensitive Arkanians to adopt what seems to be an atypical approach when encountering other
              species treating them with kindness and respect. In truth, they are simply seeking a new kind of Arkanian perfection.</p>

            <p>Arkanian pride, though certainly inflated, is not without some merit. Arkanians are masters of genetic technology
              and bioengineering. In addition to mastering cutting-edge techniques of sentient breeding, their advancements
              have led to some of the galaxy’s most effective biological weapons—all of which they are willing to sell to
              the highest bidder.</p>
            <p>This arrogant pragmatism has led to the perception that Arkanians have no moral qualms with their technology
              being sold to nefarious clients and being used in galactic atrocities. However, a significant minority of the
              Arkanian people do hold a great moral objection to their advancements being used to commit such horrible crimes.
              These Arkanians hold to the belief that once physiological and technological perfection has been achieved,
              one must also achieve moral perfection to become a perfect being.</p>
