    <p><b>Karkarodons</b>, a divided people once unconcerned
      about galactic affairs, now find themselves conflicted
      about their place in the war. Though their homeworld
      has remained officially neutral in the Clone Wars, their
      new war industry has definitively allied with the Separatists, so they find themselves participants in a war
      they never asked for. Some have been enticed by the
      prospect of forming a strong Karkarodon identity and
      the promise of a fledgling empire with colonies. Others want to retreat back into their solitary tradition.
      Still others want the people of Karkaris to
      unite under no banner but their own.</p>

            <p>Tall and lanky, with
              webbed feet and hands, Karkarodons have a short, flattened
              face but a large, powerful
              jaw. They have gills but can
              breathe air. Their skin
              tones range from gray
              and brown to blue
              and white. They
              sometimes have
              dark-and-light
              patterns, spots, or
              stripes on their skin.</p>
            <p>Other than
              their partial bone
              skeleton and a flexible cartilage frame,
              Karkarodons’ bodies
              consist of almost
              solid muscle. As their
              hearts are undersized compared
              to those of other species, Karkarodons use constant motion to boost their blood
              circulation through muscular action. Their physiology makes them powerful swimmers, but on land,
              they become sluggish if prevented from constant
              movement; still, they always remain strong.</p>

            <p>The Karkarodon political landscape is
              both exceedingly simple and maddeningly complex.
              Karkaris has a weak global government, and the
              Karkarodons prefer it that way. They have a representative in the Galactic Senate, but all politicos know
              the open secret that the representative has no real
              authority. Karkarodons simply did not care about
              having an official voice in the Senate.</p>
            <p>Officially, Karkaris is neutral in the Clone Wars,
              but the Republic sees full well that it has unofficially
              backed the Confederacy of Independent Systems. In
              the Separatist Parliament, Karkaris has strong, almost
              aggressive representation, and the other senators
              find the enthusiasm infectious, unaware that those
              Karkarodons actually represent a minority group.</p>
            <p>Karkarodon society traditionally focuses on smaller social groups rather than adhering to a broader Karkarodon identity. Their complex, contradictory,
              and fluid societal norms confound offworld anthropologists. Most Karkarodons have no interest in galactic
              politics, focusing on their individual success, security, and wealth. Perhaps not surprisingly, offworld
              Karkarodons have no problem associating with other
              species, viewing them on an individual level, through
              personal relationships. Among themselves, Karkarodons tend to engage in aggressive competition.</p>
            <p>A minority of Karkarodons have engaged with the galaxy on a higher political level, proclaiming themselves
              representatives of their homeworld. Count Dooku and
              the Separatists have enticed members of this group primarily with promises of riches and empire, to make the
              galaxy their ocean. While a declaration of allegiance to
              the CIS seems inevitable, other Karkarodons are beginning to see the host of problems this would bring.</p>

            <p><b>Karkaris</b>, an ocean planet, lies in the
              Outer Rim. It belongs to the Nilgaard sector, an area
              of space strongly allied with the Separatists at the
              far end of the Perlemian Trade Route. The temperate
              planet does have small, scattered landmasses, but its
              biodiversity primarily lies in the oceans. Life is abundant throughout the seas, from the warm equatorial
              currents to the thick waters under the polar ice caps.
              For most Karkarodons, this pelagic paradise provides
              everything they need.</p>
            <p>Like most temperate ocean planets, Karkaris has
              massive storms, so Karkarodons live deep in the undercurrents. Due to heavy volcanism, their cities rest in
              the middle of the tectonic plates, though compared
              to their land-based equivalents, Karkarodon cities are
              fairly decentralized and spread out over longer distances. Due to the Karkarodons’ industrial ramp-up,
              they have built geothermal plants over vents. The new
              military factories sit nearby, shoving out weapons and
              cybernetic war beasts at a rapid rate.</p>
            <p>Karkaris used to have only a few small, unofficial
              starports on those scattered landmasses, but now
              towering structures reach up out of the water. Dozens
              of freighters, all from the Confederacy of Independent Systems, carry weapons out and bring supplies
              and specialists in. The rapid pace of industry means
              that these areas suffer from thick industrial sludge, a
              result of waste product and cooling water drainage.
              The reef die-off in these areas concerns many Karkarodons, not due to environmental concerns, but due to
              potential poisoning. In keeping with true Karkarodon
              nature, most have simply left those areas or obtained
              work in the factories. Still, a growing number worry
              Karkaris could become blighted and uninhabitable.</p>

            <p>The minority group of Karkarodons who allied with the Separatists saw a chance

              themselves up as sovereigns of other ocean worlds,
              like Mon Cala. The CIS has promised them those
              worlds, but many of these Karkarodons desire more.
              Other Karkarodons struggle with this alliance, however, often arguing among themselves over even the
              subject of unity.</p>
            <p>Apathetic Karkarodons only care about the material
              benefits of the alliance. The money from the Separatists has brought prosperity, but it has lulled its people
              into a false sense of security. A few Karkarodons see
              the danger in allying with the Separatists and giving
              up control over their own planet. Unfortunately, their
              peers can only see as far as their own prosperity, not

              Karkaris’s oceans—their wildlife—and melds
              them with cybernetic implants. The Hydroid

              their electric fields, can withstand blaster

            <p>Karkarodons also use these technologies to
