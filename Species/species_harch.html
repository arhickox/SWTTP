    <p>Traditionally individualistic, exacting, and aggressive,
      <b>Harches</b> have changed their societal attitudes rapidly
      in the past two decades. The Harch have been expanding out into the galaxy, their belligerence and avarice
      syncing well with the Spiverelda, the totalitarian government of the Lambda sector. Their individualism
      meant they resisted developing a monolithic Harch
      identity until the Republic sided against them in favor
      of the Andoan Free Colonies. The Harches believe
      that ever since, the Republic has denied them profit
      and the spoils of war. With the Separatists, the Harches see an opportunity for justice.</p>

            <p>Harch physiology, which derives from
              their arachnid ancestors, features six fully functional
              arms and two legs. Harches have two large primary
              eyes and four smaller ones above, less capable of
              seeing colors and details, but excellent at sensing
              movement and changes in light. The hair that covers their bodies ranges from brown to pale gray, and
              they sport two large, protruding jaws, or chelicerae.
              Though shorter and stockier than humans, Harches
              weigh about the same due to their tough exoskeleton.</p>
            <p>As a result of their genetic diversity, some Harches
              inherit their ancestors’ spinnerets or venom. Harches
              prefer a liquefied protein diet, but they can and do
              eat solid meat and vegetation. They are genetic cousins to the Aqualish. According to rumor, Harches are
              long-lived, with lifespans that stretch centuries.</p>

            <p>Traditional Harch society didn’t have war in
              the traditional sense of the word. Though Harches are
              as capable of violence as any other species, their individualism tended to obstruct organization into
              large
              armies. They could band together in smaller groups
              and skirmish with enemies, but they never had a planetwide standing army until recently.</p>
            <p>In earlier times, individual Harches might wander
              the galaxy to make their fortunes, and though they
              sometimes returned to the homeworld, most had no
              more allegiance or loyalty to other Harches more than
              to non-Harch friends and peers. Harch cultural groups
              and subspecies, of which there were a vast number,
              had widely different cultural norms. Communities of
              Harches on other words often incorporated the local
              culture into their own.</p>
            <p>This changed during the Andoan Wars more than
              twenty years ago, when the ruling nests decided to
              back the Spiverelda government of the Aqualish in
              suppressing the Andoan Free Colonies. The Harch
              homeworld turned their industry toward warfare,
              but its militarization likely would have subsided if
              the Republic hadn’t stepped in to spare the Andoan
              Free Colonies, dashing the dreams of a “Great Harch
              Prosperity.” Still smarting from that insult, instead of
              returning their economy to peacetime production,
              Harches continued building weapons of war, selling
              them to corporate interests and ignoring Republic
              restrictions. Eventually, they joined the Separatists.</p>
            <p>Many of the solitary and individualistic Harches
              still remain scattered across the galaxy. Those who
              have stayed on their homeworld, who are more predisposed to cooperation and social hierarchies, have
              formed a powerful information network to serve the
              ruling nests. Since the Andoan Wars, the more solitary and the more social Harches have been working
              well together. Offworld Harches sell information and
              contacts to the ruling nests, which in turn use the
              information to improve the homeworld or support
              other offworld Harches.</p>
            <p>While Harches away from the homeworld have a
              more galaxy-spanning view of politics, they have also
              been infected with a pro-homeworld, antigalaxy sentiment. Even their membership in the CIS hasn’t altered
              their newly formed distrust of other species. Most
              believe their alliance with the Separatists should be
              one of equal partnership that supports the new Harch
              ascendency. If the Separatist government ever acts in
              a way that appears to disadvantage them, the ruling
              nests fully intend to act aggressively against their former allies. After all, it is their right.</p>

            <p><b>Secundus Ando</b>, located in the Mid
              Rim, is a temperate, cavern-riddled planet with a wide
              variety of ecosystems. It sports massive, craggy trees
              rooted in loamy earth in ecologically protected parks.
              Within these massive trees, the wealthy Harch ruling
              nests sit in the center of a network of information as
              intricate as the webs their ancestors once made. These
              green and flourishing paradises, of course, cost such a
              vast amount of credits that the average Harch citizen
              could never afford the real estate in their lifetime.
            </p>
            <p>The majority of the population lives in the megacities. These industrial areas look like mechanical
              mockeries of Secundus Ando’s preserved, arboreal
              areas. Giant spires and cloudcutters funnel waste gases into the upper atmosphere from the war factories
              on the ground levels. The Harch people’s craving for war has expanded industry into their oceans—since
              the ruling nests control significant protected territory-through the development of artificial islands.
              The water serves both as cooling source and waste-disposal system.</p>

            <p>Harches speak Harchic, Aqualish, and

              “accent” in the form of rapid clicks. For centuries,
              Aqualish was their primary language due to the influence of the nearby Aqualish species, with Basic a
              close second. This is still the case for the older generations, but in the past twenty years, Harchic has
              become the primary and official language of Secundus Ando, pushing the Republic’s Galactic Basic down
              to a distant third place. Younger generations of Harches have made Harchic their only language, which has
              been somewhat inconvenient for Harch homeworlders

            <p>This did not happen by accident. The ruling nests have always pushed Harch society
