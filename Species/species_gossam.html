    <p>A small species of reptilian origin, <b>Gossams</b> have exerted a greater influence on galactic history than their
      slender frames might suggest. Gossams have a reputation for being unable to resist a profitable venture, such as prominent
      colonies and even pirate fleets. In a move that turned out to be spectacularly unprofitable, the Gossam leader of the
      Republic’s Commerce Guild secretly colluded with the Confederacy of Independent Systems in the Separatist crisis, but
      the Gossam species weathered the fallout more easily than other Separatist allies. The Empire’s retribution was typically
      indiscriminate, but the Gossams’ natural independence and diversified interests weakened any attempts to pin consequences
      upon them. Gossams on their homeworld—Castell—were enslaved by the Empire, and the species was banned from setting
      foot on Coruscant. However, independent members of the species remain spread throughout the galaxy, waiting for the
      right moment to assert their interests. Many of these individuals—entrepreneurs, explorers, and members of a thousand
      other professions—have thrown in their sympathy or resources with the Rebellion.</p>

              of greater height. Gossams move with an easy grace on three-toed feet, and their three-fingered hands are just

            <p>After a devastating economic depression that crippled their society, Gossams restructured their lives around
              the Republic’s Commerce Guild. Initially, all Gossams were indentured to the Commerce Guild to pay off a debt
              for the stabilization of their homeworld, Castell. Their situation improved over time, but their society has
              retained the tradition of beginning adult life with a period of indenture in order to gain experience with
              the galaxy at large.</p>
            <p>Of course, Gossams have never been great sticklers for tradition, so with the dissolution of the Commerce
              Guild and the Empire’s seizure of Castell, few cultural factors remain to unify Gossams still at large in the
              galaxy. Their shrewd ability to avoid being pinned down defines them more than anything else.</p>

            <p>The Gossam homeworld of <b>Castell</b> is a heavily industrialized foundry world. Before the rise of the Empire,
              the production lines of Castell were a source of wealth and influence for the species, even if their exploitative
              indenture system kept the workers from receiving direct benefit. Castell produced virtually everything, including
              luxury goods, speeders, and even advanced starship components. Now, the Imperial occupation has forced Gossams
              to retool their manufacturing plants to produce the munitions and other tools of conquest that keep them oppressed.
              The indenture experienced in the years prior to the occupation pales in comparison to the grinding slave labor
              Imperial overseers now demand, and as long as the Empire stands, no end is in sight.</p>

            <p>Gossams give up even the smallest bit of independence with great reluctance, and only when they are sure to
              benefit. A Gossam rarely adopts a cause without seeking to profit from it. However, even though the Rebellion
              has seemingly little to offer, many free Cossams find themselves with Rebel sympathies, giving everything they
              have in the hopes of securing a future improved beyond price.</p>
            <p>Rebel Cossams often take up jobs that require little oversight and allow them to use their genius for improvisation.
              They operate in intelligence as often as they do in diplomacy, and a few have even found their way into command
              positions. Steady nerves and a high-risk, high-reward attitude lead a surprising number of elite Cossams to
              pilot Rebel starfighters.</p>

            <p>Because of the Gossams’ support of the Separatist cause, the Empire issued an edict banning the species from
              visiting or staying on the capital world of Coruscant. The new law was enacted with no warning given to the
              numerous Gossam merchants, pilots, and travelers on planet at the time. Enforcement began almost immediately,
              so many Gossams found themselves suddenly hunted by agents of the new law, and their ships and assets were
              seized by the Imperial authorities.</p>
            <p>Many of the Gossams visiting Coruscant were immediately apprehended, but a surprising number were able to
              evade capture through connections with the underworld, ties with shipping guilds, or their innate cunning.
              A few were able to smuggle themselves offworld, but most were stuck on Coruscant as wanted criminals. These
              Gossams on Coruscant, along with other victims of punitive Imperial justice, organized a resistance movement
              code-named Whiplash.</p>
            <p>Operatives of Whiplash are rarely able to make contact with the Rebellion, much less join its operations,
              but the two organizations share information and resources for mutual benefit whenever possible. The Rebel Alliance
              desperately needs intelligence from the center of Imperial activity, and it often finds use for personnel who
              become too notorious for Whiplash to shelter. In return, trusted smugglers and agents of the Rebellion provide
              Whiplash with their only lifeline to the galaxy beyond Coruscant, including supply runs, communications, and
              the occasional exfiltration. Despite their close relationship, meetings between agents are fraught with tension
              and mistrust, as the dangers of betrayal are never greater than at the heart of Imperial power.</p>
