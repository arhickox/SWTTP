    <p>Originally hailing from the Outer Rim world of Kallidah, the Kallidahin are more often referred to as <b>Polis Massans</b>.
      They are best known for their vast and intricate archaeological digs in the asteroid field that shares their adopted
      name. The Polis Massan people have searched for centuries, looking for a link between themselves and an enigmatic species—now
      extinct—called the Eellayin. Peaceful and isolationist, Polis Massans are experts in the fields of archaeology, medicine,
      and xenobiology.</p>

            <p>Polis Massans are a small-bodied species standing an average of 1.4 meters tall. They are descended from a
              cetacean ancestor, as evidenced by smooth, gray skin covering a thin layer of insulating blubber. With the
              exception of a pair of expressionless black eyes, Polis Massans possess no facial features at all. Despite
              this, they are incredibly communicative in their use of gestures, signs, and body language. Though the majority
              of Polis Massans lack vocal chords, they are able to communicate with others using a simple form of telepathy.</p>

            <p>Polis Massan society is based on community, the desire for fulfilling work, and a deep hunger for knowledge.
              Though they lack a shared consciousness, Polis Massans see their species as a collective in which everyone
              is supportive of one another and eachmember serves an important role. As such, every Polis Massan views his
              fellows as siblings. Though there are invariably differences of opinion between individuals, they attempt to
              bridge these gaps by using their shared ancestry as common ground.</p>
            <p>Polis Massans are kind and pacifistic to a fault. While fully capable of defending themselves, they seldom
              take up arms due to their belief that all life is sacred. Aggression is not in their nature, and anger and
              hatred are foreign concepts to them. This often leads to their being taken advantage of, since they rarely,
              if ever, put up any sort of struggle when their interests are threatened.</p>
            <p>The overwhelming focus of the Polis Massan people is their attempt to find some link between themselves and
              the Eellayin. They view the Eellayin as kin, however distant, who were lost to some unknowable apocalypse.
              They seek to keep the memory and works of this mysterious species alive through their own research, even going
              so far as to attempt to clone them from Eellayin genetic material discovered in their explorations of the asteroids’
              depths.

            <p>The Polis Massans are originally from Kallidah, a moist and temperate world in the Subterrel sector. Soon
              after establishing a base on <b>Polis Massa</b> in an attempt to research the Eellayin people, the entire species
              relocated to the barren asteroid in order to support the excavations there. Though Kallidah is relatively close
              to Polis Massa, the Polis Massans have found no reason to return to their original homeworld.</p>
            <p>Polis Massa is the largest asteroid in the Polis Massa Asteroid Field. The field is composed of countless
              fragments of the Eellayin homeworld, which was destroyed by some kind of cataclysm long ago. Though the asteroid
              is airless and incapable of supporting life, the Polis Massans have established a number of outposts where

            <p>The diminutive people of Polis Massa have delved into the depths of their asteroid home in search of traces
              of the Eellayin people. Though the majority of their discoveries involve artifacts and relics from that ill-fated
              species, they have also managed to recover a significant amount of genetic material. Presumably Eellayin in
              origin, this genetic material comprises the most precious discoveries the Polis Massans have made.</p>
            <p>Following long years analyzing the alien DNA, the Polis Massans decided to use their own cloning techniques
              in an attempt to recreate an Eellayin. Doing so required them to construct a high-end cloning facility in the
              Polis Massa Research Base. Though most of the facility’s equipment was built by the Polis Massans themselves,
              they had little compunction about purchasing additional paraphernalia from the Kaminoans, a little-known species
              possessing exceptionally advanced cloning methods.</p>
            <p>Though Polis Massan cloning techniques are advanced by most standards, they are focused primarily on their
              species’ own physiology. Their initial attempts to recreate an Eellayin from the recovered genetic material
              met with failure. While the Polis Massans have successfully cloned members of extinct species in the past,
              the quality of the Eellayin genetic material has been subpar and incomplete.</p>
            <p>Since their failed attempts to clone an Eellayin, the Polis Massans have approached the Kaminoans once more
              and asked for their direct assistance. The Kaminoans have since sent a number of specialists to Polis Massa
              Research Base to analyze the genetic material the Polis Massans have on hand. Additionally, the Kaminoan specialists
              are reviewing the Polis Massan cloning techniques and equipment in an attempt to improve them. As is their
              way, the Polis Massans have kept their involvement with the Kaminoans a secret, and they aren’t inclined to
              share the knowledge with anyone else.</p>
            <p>Additional Eellayin DNA continues to be discovered, analyzed, and cataloged by Polis Massan exobiologists.
              While a successfully cloned Eellayin has yet to be created, both the Polis Massans and their Kaminoan advisors
              are certain that their efforts are going to bear fruit given time. The implications of such a success continue
              to remain a mystery.</p>
