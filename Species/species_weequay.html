    <p><b>Weequays</b> are harsh creatures from a harsh homeworld. They have thick, toughened skin and a dense, powerful
      bone structure, and are often seen as ideal bodyguards due to this natural resilience and durability. Their cultural
      structure, idealizing violence and conflict, also makes them more than likely to follow the path of the Hired Gun or
      other occupations that emphasize martial prowess over more intellectual pursuits.</p>
    <p>Most Weequays tend to be quiet, solitary beings, speaking very little to outsiders. However, this has not stopped
      some Weequays from rising to prominence as pirates and brigands across the galaxy. There were even a few Weequay Jedi
      once, and some Weequays fight with the Rebellion against the Galactic Empire. Those who leave their homeworld are generally
      more gregarious than their fellows, although their personalities tend towards sardonic and biting.</p>
    <p>Weequays can communicate nonverbally through a discharge of pheromones from their bodies, but this form of communication
      is only possible among members of the same clan across relatively short distances. This trait, however, might help
      to explain why many view Weequays as taciturn even among their own kind. It's also the likely cause of the bitter,
      caustic scent most species associate with Weequays.</p>

            <p>Weequays are humanoids averaging roughly two meters in height. Their desert homeworld results in coarse, hardened

              Weequay faces are rigid and lipless, with a bony frill or crest down either jawline.</p>

              one for each of their native years spent away from home. Less traditional males, however, might not follow
              this. Weequays' eyes are sunk deeply in the folds and creases of their weathered faces, providing better protection

            <p>Weequay society is complex and brutal. Built around the clan unit, Weequay society is pitilessly impersonal,
              with each individual striving to honor his various gods in his own way. These gods symbolize both natural forces
              on Sriluur as well as the spirits of important animals. The two most important gods worshiped by Weequays are
              Am-Shak the thunder god and Quay, the god of Sriluur's brightest moon. Weequays usually honor their gods in
              ceremonies that focus on the sacrifice of a worthy opponent, either in hunt or in battle. Generally, this is
              some large or vicious beast</p>
            <p>The recently-ended war with the Houk resulted in more Weequay warriors trained in modern equipment and tactics,
              and also developing dispositions at odds with their clannish origins. Many of these idle warriors eventually
              chose to leave their homeworld to seek gainful employment elsewhere, most finding positions in mercenary companies
              or as blasters-for-hire for a wide range of organizations and individuals.</p>

            <p>Weequays are native to the planet <b>Sriluur</b> in the Sriluur system. An inhospitable world primarily composed
              of arid deserts, terrible volcanoes, and corrosive seas, Sriluur is located just Core-ward of Hutt Space along
              the Sisar Run. The planet is also home to another sentient species, the Houk, who attempted to colonize the
              planet over 200 years ago. This resulted in a state of restless antagonism lasting centuries, and has recently
              erupted into open warfare. This WeequayHouk war lasted for more than ten years, ending in an uneasy peace just
              before the Battle of Yavin.</p>
            <p>Sriluur has recently been subjected to Imperial occupation for fear of growing criminal activity, Hutt involvement,
              and civil unrest. A sizable military presence on the planet has not curbed the region's chaotic nature, however,
              and neither the Weequay nor the Houk are known for their Imperial sympathies.</p>

              this habit can make the Weequays seem aloof and forbidding.</p>

            <p> Weequays who venture off Sriluur are frequently employed as bodyguards or other contracted combatants. Their
              natural durability gives them an edge in battle, which often comes as a surprise to those not familiar with
              the species. In addition, the ferocious and belligerent nature of their society makes them eminently suited
              to roles in the sinister world of galactic crime and the grey peripheries of society.</p>
            <p>There have been many instances when Weequays have risen to positions of prominence within such shadowy organizations.
              The more adventurous Weequays who venture off their homeworld tend to be more cunning and astute than the species
              average. Coupled with their cynical and scheming view of reality, this tends to give them an edge in dealing
              with a galaxy more familiar with the quietly savage stereotype of the species. Many criminal figures have entered
              into dealings with a Weequay planning to victimize a simple and unsophisticated species, only to find themselves

            <p>The name Weequay literally translates to "follower of Quay." Most Weequays do not embark on any important
              action without first consulting any of a variety of totems in order to seek the guidance of their gods. Those
              Weequays seeking the assistance of Quay specifically use a totem known as a Quay, which is often seen as being
              a part of the great god himself.</p>
            <p>Many Weequays consult their Quay before any sort of enterprise. However, most sentient races dismiss the use
              of the Quay as pointless superstition, seeing the totem as little more than a clever child's toy. In fact,
              those Weequays who rose to the rank of Jedi came almost exclusively from backgrounds that precluded their belief
              in the ancestral gods and the consultation of totems, including the Quay. Because of this prejudice, many prominent
              Weequays forego the public use of the Quay as well, or eschew the totems altogether.</p>
