      <b>Cereans</b> are a distinctive species. Though they are similar in appearance to humans, their one noticeable difference
      comprises their extended, almost cone-like skulls, which house large, binary brains (in essence, two brains closely
      linked together). Because of their binary brains, members of this humanoid species can simultaneously pursue multiple
      lines of thought and have extraordinary mental aptitude. The species is also known for attention to detail as well
      as a cultural tendency toward extended contemplation.</p>

            <p>Cereans are mammalian, with anatomy very similar to that of humans. The most notable dif­ ferences are the
              presence of the enlarged, conical cra­ nium—to accommodate the binary brain structure—as well as a pair of
              hearts to improve blood circulation. Cereans are generally regarded as somewhat less physically coordinated
              than humans.</p>
            <p>Cereans exhibit an unusual sexual dimorphism. Female births outnumber male births by a ratio of twenty to
              one. Further, males age more rapidly than females. Consequently, female Cereans dominate the world’s population.</p>

            <p>Cerean culture is focused on preserving the undamaged portions of their homeworld and living in harmony with
              the natural world. Meditation is a cen­ tral part of their lives, often in conjunction with kasha crystals.
              These stones aid in calming and cleansing the mind, helping users to harness their natural energies.</p>
            <p>Partly due to their imbalanced sexual ratio, Cer­ ean society is primarily matriarchal. The government is
              ruled by a president who works with a Council of Elders. Decisions are made only after lengthy discus­ sions
              that thoroughly analyze both sides of an issue, with concerted efforts toward achieving objectivity. No­ tably,
              once the council makes a resolution, its decision is final, with no opportunity for appeal. Cereans believe
              so absolutely in their infallibility that they assume all decisions made by the council are correct. Revisiting
              such a decision may only happen due to changing cir­cumstances or new, previously unknown information.</p>
            <p>Tradition plays a major role in Cerean life. This be­ gins with an individual’s name. Most Cereans have three
              names, derived from their parents and grand­ parents. Clothing styles are also highly traditional, established
              over centuries. Many Cereans train in the use of an ancient, curved sword known as the shyarn. Duelists often
              focus on a highly artistic and stylized combat style as a means of releasing their aggression. Some argue that
              this catharsis plays a critical role in maintaining their peaceful society.</p>

            <p>After the Battle of Cerea and the later killing of Cerean Jedi Master Ki-Adi-Mundi by his own troops during
              the Jedi Purges, Cerea with­ drew inward to nurse its wounds and tend to itself. However, Cereans historically
              have had a suspicious attitude toward outsiders.</p>
            <p>Cereans have always worked to maintain har­ mony with themselves and their environment. Consequentially, they
              limit the amount of tech­ nology they use in their everyday life, especially if that technology could harm
              the planetary ecology. The Cereans have also generally made a point to limit the impact non-Cereans can have
              on their planet. Thus, outsiders and immi­grants may only settle in the so-called Outsider Citadels. These
              vast structures tower over the surrounding landscapes. Within the Citadels’ of­ ten cramped and squalid confines,
              non-Cereans are free to live without following the Cereans’ strict rules concerning offworld technology and
              non-polluting lifestyles. Needless to say, this has led to the Outsider Citadels’ having become havens of vice
              and criminal enterprise.</p>
