    <p>Secretive and unknown, <b>Kaminoans</b> launched
      themselves into galactic history—or infamy—by single-handedly creating the Grand Army of the Republic.
      While they have been ascending politically and financially, many Kaminoans feel their people have gone
      too far too soon by getting involved in galactic affairs.</p>
    <p>The flooding of their planet ages ago led the Kaminoans to engineer a means of survival. They constructed
      spires and towers anchored to the ground—later, the
      sea floor. They created gene banks to preserve the
      land-based species. Finally, they turned to genetic
      manipulation not only to adapt their flora and fauna to this new environment, but to modify their own
      genetics to inhabit their altered world.</p>
    <p>As isolationists, the Kaminoan political class invited only specific and wealthy offworld individuals
      to visit their homeworld for the purposes of trade.
      In exchange for the science and resources to maintain life on Kamino, they offered their biological and
      genetic artistry. One such service was cloning.</p>
    <p>When Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas contacted Kamino
      with a bold proposal to produce a full army of clone
      soldiers, the Kaminoans debated the wisdom of such
      a project. Creating a whole army for the Galactic
      Republic would shine a spotlight onto the planet. Yet,
      the income would provide for their homeworld for
      generations to come and would secure the Kaminoans an influential seat in the Galactic Senate—on their
      own terms. In the end, the Kaminoans did what they
      have always done: adapt. And thus, the history of the
      galaxy changed forever.

            <p>Taller than the average human, Kaminoans tend to be slim, with a distinctive elongated neck
              and oblong head. Male Kaminoans are identifiable by
              the finlike crest atop their head. The species’ large,
              dark eyes with white pupils have the ability to pick
              out subtle variations in hue and even to see into the
              ultraviolet end of the spectrum. For this reason, Kaminoans favor white in their clothing and
              architecture,
              since “white” to them contains a multitude of hues.

            <p>Although it is a planned society, Kaminoan
              culture possesses a surprising amount of flexibility
              and uncertainty. Kaminoans genetically engineer and
              plan their offspring’s lives and futures. Their children enter society in the role assigned to them,
              taking an
              occupation based on their genetic “destiny.”</p>
            <p>Yet, within this structured society is a great deal of
              variation. Some Kaminoans believe that their genetic
              destiny lies in engineering a perfect Kaminoan, and
              engage in lively debates on what that actually means.
              Others develop a certain fascination with genetic
              anomalies and what it means to “deviate” from a
              genetic plan. To the average Kaminoan, genetics, destiny, and the future are inseparable.

            <p><b>Kamino</b> once had a temperate climate,
              with land, ice caps, oceans, and variable weather. At
              the end of an ice age and the loss of its ice caps, Kamino became an aquatic planet. The increase in
              thermal
              energy also caused the near-constant high winds and
              thunderstorms that span the planet to this day.
            </p>
            <p>Scattered across the world, Kaminoan cities are
              anchored to the ocean floor, rising high above the surface so that the Kaminoans can harness power from
              the wind and collect fresh rainwater. Even power is
              generated by lightning strikes and stored in independent energy cores.</p>
            <p>The location of Kamino was removed from astronavigation charts as part of the Kaminoans’ arrangement
              with Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas. Regardless of this acceptance of commerce with offworlders and their new
              seat in the Senate, the majority of Kaminoans still harbor strong isolationist tendencies. Now that they
              have
              influence in the Senate, the Kaminoans have ambitious plans to establish their own clone security force
              using the template from the Republic’s clone army,
              in order to ensure that they are able to maintain any
              level of isolation they choose.

              other languages as well. Those few who leave the

              polymaths—understand and appreciate the wide,
              confusing, and vital diversity of languages and cultures. In general, however, Kaminoans who speak

            <p>t the time of their great flood, Kaminoans
              had not developed sophisticated space-travel technology, and the Galactic Republic
              had only just started their great expansion
              into the Slice. Kaminoans did the calculus
              and felt that the risk of being colonized as a
              result of petitioning for aid from the distant
              Republic, as well as the likely costs in resources and cultural change, were worse than the
              risks posed by modifying their planet and
              genetic code. Though the Kaminoans survived
              and continue to thrive, that decision has left
              them with a residual distrust toward offers of
              offworld help. Kaminoans do not necessarily
              view their species as superior, but they see
              other worlds as a distraction. Many believe
              that everything they need is on Kamino itself.</p>
