    <p>Most citizens of the Galactic Republic regard <b>clones</b>
      as being synonymous with the Grand Army of the
      Republic. Considered to be as faceless, identical, and
      emotionless as the members of droid army they fight,
      clones know of their origins and purpose. Rather than
      struggle against their destiny, most Republic clones
      fully accept their engineered life, celebrating their
      bonds of purpose and background.</p>
    <p>From a certain point of view, the clones of the Grand
      Army of the Republic have the strongest ethical fabric
      in the galaxy. They fight for a greater good: the safety
      and protection of the Galactic Republic. They willingly
      sacrifice themselves for their brothers-in-arms. The
      majority would never even consider betraying those
      ideals. What other sentient can say that?</p>

            <p>Physically identical, and based on the
              genetic template of bounty hunter Jango Fett, clones
              can be considered standard humans—though they
              age at a vastly accelerated rate as a necessity for the
              creation and sustainment of the fighting force. When decanted, almost all clones share Jango Fetts black
              hair, dark-brown eye color, and olive skin tone. Some
              genetic variants exist, although most are confined to
              Kamino as case studies—or embarrassments.</p>

          <div class="card-body">
            <p>Genetically tailored for obedience and
              trained for loyalty, clones develop a sense of family
              with their peers and many of their commanders, who
              are like their brothers and wise elders. Even though
              Jedi Knights and Jedi Masters serve as generals and
              high-ranked commanders, shaping and deeply affecting the clones’ lives, clones don’t consider them
              family. For example, even though it could be argued
              that Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas was responsible for the
              clones’ existence, the clones instead consider the
              near-mythologized Jango Fett to be their father figure.</p>
            <p>Despite the common public perception, clones of
              the Grand Army do have individual traits and personalities. Most have individual nicknames, and even
              clone commanders identify each of their soldiers with
              particular skills and talents. After all, if one clone
              soldier has shown competence in an ability, such as
              demolitions, his commander has to be able to identify and order him to perform that task. As sentient
              beings, the clones recognize not only their similarities to but also their differences from each other;
              despite their rigorous military training, they experience unintentional social pressures from their peers
              both to conform and to stand out. A clone soldier
              who takes on a reckless—but successful—action gets
              called “reckless” by his peers. This gives him a reputation for recklessness, which, strangely enough,
              might compel the clone to undertake further brash actions.
              The intensity of war exacerbates this tendency, so the
              older and more seasoned a clone gets, the more personality quirks he develops.</p>
            <p>Of course, the rare clones who escape the military program accrue a haphazard education, usually
              focused on survival. Nevertheless, they retain many of
              their military habits. Despite their personality quirks
              and personal beliefs, these runaway clones still refer
              to their peers as “brothers."</p>

              clones feel a great regard for their homeworld and are
              fiercely protective of it.</p>
            <p>As an engineered people in service to the Republic, clones of the Grand Army tend to see their fellow
              soldiers as family, dead comrades as ancestors, new
              recruits as descendants, and their ships or barracks
              as their places of work. Clones generally have little
              reason to return to Kamino, yet the word “home”
              conjures thoughts of the planet, especially after the

              the most part to practical military knowledge. Continued exposure to other cultures may give them time to learn, but not enough to be fluent.
              Time in the field tends to pepper a
              clone’s language with military jargon and slang, such as “ciankers”
              or “rollers” (for droids),
              “poppers” (grenades), and “shinies”

            <p>Republic officials are well aware that clones
              have been modified to behave less independently than their template. However,
              unknown to the Republic, the clones, and the
              majority of their Kaminoan cloners are the
              inhibitor chips installed in the part of each
              clone’s brain that controls aggression. A chip,
              by modifying aggressive feelings, manipulates
              the clone’s emotions regarding obedience
              and loyalty to those in authority and anger
              toward their enemies. Being biological in
              composition, the chips suffer no vulnerability
              to EMP and have a low chance of rejection
              by a clone’s immune system. Even with an
              advanced medical scan, a chip appears to be
              merely an enlarged gland that helps stimulate
              adrenaline production for energy and other
              hormones to regulate emotional stability.</p>
