              using tube-like shields that protect their eyes, and breathe
              through simple filters that keep them from inhaling the sand particles that constantly swirl
              through the Tatooine air. Every piece of their
              attire serves to keep moisture trapped near
              their bodies, and hygiene is only attended
              to in complete privacy, for seeing another individual’s face, even accidentally, is cause for a blood

            <p>Tusken Raiders are ruthless fighters, hardened by
              their harsh environment to
              show no mercy to other species. They fear little, although they can be
              driven away by a
              substantial display
              of force. Traveling in
              bands of up to twenty
              or thirty, they nearly always ride their bantha mounts in a straight
              line, journeying one behind the other to hide
              their numbers from enemies. Their weapon of
              choice is the gaderffii, or gaffi stick, which is
              basically a double-edged ax made of cannibalized metal scavenged from abandoned or
              wrecked vehicles. Some carry blaster rifles,
              but Tusken blasters are not the most powerful or technologically advanced weapons.
            </p>
            <p>This nomadic people was the dominant
              sentient species on Tatooine before settlers began to colonize the world during
              the days of the Old Republic. The Jawas,
              the only other sentients on the planet,
              while more intelligent, were not as large
              or fierce as their brutal neighbors, although there is some scientific evidence that suggests the two
              groups
              may both be descended from the
              same species, an ancient race known as the Kumumgah. The Tusken Raiders received their
              galaxy-recognized name from an attack they launched on a
              human settlement called Fort Tusken. While their attempt
              to force out the offworld settlers failed, this assault became
              renowned for its brutality. In response, the settlers set about
              to attempt the utter destruction of the Sand People, eliminating entire tribes at a time—leading to their
              near extinction before the few remaining tribes retreated to hide in the
              desert wastes.</p>
            <p>As a result of these incidents, Sand People are inherently angered by the presence in their
              territories of offworld settlers, whom they feel
              encroach upon their ration of water and food.
              They will often attack moisture farmers and settlers without provocation—simply for the sake
              of intimidating those they perceive as enemies.
              Despite their bullying natures, Tusken Raiders will typically shy away from massive Jawa
              sandcrawler fortresses, heavily protected
              farmsteads, large cities, and even settlements,
              as well as from the vicious krayt dragons. It is
              evident that they favor situations where they
              have the upper hand, and will only take calculated risks.</p>
            <p>Since they are a nomadic people, they
              maintain no permanent shelters and keep few
              possessions, viewing such belongings as liabilities. Regardless of their willingness to move
              regularly, they allow no other changes in their
              society or culture. Tusken Raiders fear machinery, the power of which has decimated their
              people in the past, and are thus thoroughly
              resistant to technology, stealing very little of
              it from hapless patrols, caravans, and moisture farmers. They feel that killing with more
              primitive weapons brings them the bravest of
              victories.

            <p>A vast yellow globe baking in the heat of its twin suns, <b>Tatooine</b> was mistaken for a star by early
              explorers of the Outer Rim—and in
              the scorching heat of high noon, locals joke that those explorers weren’t so wrong. Life on Tatooine is a
              study in perseverance, but
              despite the inhospitable conditions, there is life here. Jawas, hooded rodent-like scavengers, scour
              Tatooine’s wastes for scrap they can
              salvage. Primitive desert warriors called Tusken Raiders wander the desert, abiding by ancient tribal
              traditions. Herds of eopies root for
              buried lichen, rock warts hunt for prey, and an unlucky traveler may hear the booming cries of the
              semi-legendary krayt dragon. And
              there are more recent arrivals: humans, Hutts, and all manner of spacefaring species.</p>
            <p>Despite what bored young moisture farmers might tell you, Tatooine is fairly well known in the galaxy.
              The system sits at a juncture
              ofhyperspace routes: The Triellus Trade Route connects Hutt Space with a sizable chunk ofthe Outer Rim,
              while a loop ofthe Corellian
              Run sees traffic running to and from the Core Worlds. Space battles were common over Tatooine long before
              the planet’s settlement, and
              today Tatooine’s spaceports continue to thrive.</p>

            <p>To most outsiders, the language of Tusken
              Raiders is an unintelligible, angry combination of consonants and growls. They have no written language,
              so they
              rely on a long and complex oral tradition to keep track of
              their lineage and legends. Each tribe has a storyteller, whose
              duty is to preserve and retell the group’s history. The storyteller chronicles the coming-of-age tales for
              each member
              of the clan, and once he or she gives an account for the first
              time, not one word is permitted to change from that time
              forward. At some point, each storyteller will take on an apprentice and begin teaching the clan history,
              although the
              learner is not allowed to practice the history aloud, as the
              words must never be spoken incorrectly. If the apprentice
              makes a mistake, he or she is killed outright, as it is considered blasphemy. Once an apprentice has
              learned every tale
              of each lineage perfectly, he or she becomes the next storyteller, and the teacher will wander into the
              desert to die.</p>

            <p>Because they live such a cruel, war-like existence, the
              process of coming of age is very important to Tusken Raiders. Children are cared for by adult Tuskens,
              but they are
              not considered people until they have endured the actual
              ceremonies that bring them into maturity. Babies often perish because of the difficult desert life, and
              Sand People take great pride in knowing that only the strongest
              survive. To earn the distinction of adulthood,
              each youth must perform a great feat of skill
              or prowess, the magnitude of which determines
              his or her station in the tribe. A solemn ritual is
              held to prepare Tusken youths for their journey
              into the wilderness, during which they are given
              totems, armaments, and some water to carry
              with them. Saying no words, and showing no
              fear, they mount their banthas and head off into
              the desert. If they return with trophies showing
              that they have been victorious, they are greeted
              with grand rejoicing. A bonfire is lit, food prepared, and amid great ceremony the storyteller
              adds the young Tusken’s tale of bravery to the
              tribal history. If they do not return, no word is
              mentioned of them again.</p>
            <p>Sand People make no social distinction between males or females. Only clan leaders keep
              records on sexes, so that they can arrange
              marriages, and as soon as a youth becomes a
              recognized adult, he or she is assigned a mate.
              Through a ritual that mixes the blood of husband and wife with that of their bantha mounts,
              they are joined for life.</p>
