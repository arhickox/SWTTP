    <p>The heavy-browed, simian <b>lakaru</b> are a rare sight in the galaxy, as their species never developed hyperdrive
      technology, and relatively few ventured offworld until recent years. Most still live in the rain forest canopies of
      lakar as they have for thousands of years. However, the invasive presence of pharmaceutical corporations (and, more
      recently, the Empire) has driven many lakaru deeper into the jungles, or even offworld. It is possible that lakaru
      may become a more common presence throughout the galaxy as more escape the continued despoiling of their homeworld.</p>

              sense of a number of environmental factors, including relative movement, wind speed, and even atmospheric pressure.
              An incredible sure-footed agility, tuned by millennia of gauging death-defying leaps and swings through the
              dense jungles of lakar, complements their keen spatial awareness. Their grip is extremely strong, evolved to
              brachiate through the rain forestâ€™s branches and vines.</p>

            <p>The lakaru organize into tree-clans of fifteen to one hundred members each, led by the eldest females. They
              usually occupy the top fifty meters of jungle canopy, spending their time in a single home-tree and a few surrounding
              territory trees. The often-aggressive males occupy outer and lower branches, acting as sentries for females
              and children in the higher branches and closer to the trunk. Most males remain in the same tree-clan their
              entire lives, while females often join new clans when they come of age. lakaru seldom venture to the forest
              floor, but they do wander to other trees within their territory. Boundary disputes with neighboring tree-clans
              have led to feudal conflicts, particularly during times of food scarcity.</p>
            <p>In lakaru culture, everything belongs to the tree-clan, which stores its assets in various cubbyholes along
              the main trunk. Food is the only exception, and anthropologists often describe lakaru communal dining as akin
              to a Corellian bar brawl, except more energetic, lakaru agriculture focuses on fruit-bearing vines grown above
              the canopy and insect farming in designated trunks near the home-tree.</p>
            <p>Tree-clans near mountains have access to metals and originate most lakaru technology, which is unique, if
              obsolete by galactic standards, lakaru are limited to solar energy, for which they have little storage capacity.
              Nevertheless, they have developed repulsorlift technology, which they use to expand workspaces along branches
              and to stretch fruit vines above the canopy during the daytime.</p>
            <p>While early experiences with offworlders have left most lakaru apprehensive, some of them engage in trade
              or act as guides. The influx of offworld technology has been a boon to lakaru society, helping their civilization
              leap forward in recent decades. However, the coming of the Empire has brought with it mass deforestation, displacement,
              massacres, and more.</p>

              jungle, dense with kilometer-high trees, is interrupted by the occasional mountain range. The vertical ecosystem
              here has enabled the lakaru to dominate their world in the canopy. There, they dine on fruits, seeds, and insects,
              which they share with a number of avian species. Below the canopy, rodents and insects feed on lakaru waste

            <p>The lakaru lived in relative peace for most of their history, excepting minor conflicts between ambitious
              tree-clans. That changed during the Clone Wars, when Degan Explorations scouted the lakar system and discovered
              unique chemical compounds suitable for bacta replication and other high-value processes on lakar. Parent company
              Chiewab set up a research lab, but competitors Fabreth Medical and the nearby Merisee Prime intercepted confidential
              transmissions and rushed to establish their own facilities, lakaru defended their homes and forests, but corporate
              security often massacred or forcibly relocated entire tree-clans. Eventually, the lakaru ceded the desired
              territory and retreated farther into the trees.</p>
            <p>As the Empire exerts greater force across the galaxy but faces rising resistance, its need for medicinal support
              has been increasing. A full-scale occupation force was deployed on lakar only a few years after the Empire
              came to power. The occupiers hoped to claim any potential miracle cures that might be extracted from lakar.
              Entire stretches ofjungle were burned to make way for Imperial garrisons, driving the natives even farther
              from their homes. Scientists of the Imperial Corps of Bioengineers directed stormtroopers to capture specimens
              as they saw fit, with no regard for collateral damage. The lakaru grew desperate for a way to oust the armored
              invaders. Daring plans to build or steal ships or to stow themselves away on outbound transports have become
              common, in hopes of eventually finding a way to repel the Empire from lakaru.</p>
