    <p><b>Jawas</b> are small humanoids who live on Tatooine, the harsh
      Outer Rim desert world that was the childhood home of both
      Anakin and Luke Skywalker. While Jawas layer themselves
      under thick robes, xenobiologists, through studying
      corpses and skeletal remains, have discovered
      that they have the appearance of gaunt,
      rodent-like creatures, with shrunken faces
      and yellow eyes.

          <div class="card-body">
            <p>Each Jawa is about a meter tall, with tiny,
              flexible hands and feet. Their evolutionary
              origins are a bit mysterious. Some theories
              contend that both Jawas and their neighbors,
              the Tusken Raiders, descended from an ancient
              species known only as the Kumumgah, while
              others insist that Jawas evolved from rodents.
              If they did evolve from rodents, most scientists believe that they gradually grew in size
              and learned to walk upright by reaching for
              lichens and fungi growing on underground
              cave walls—caves that once housed the
              rare underground springs around which their
              society initially developed.</p>
            <p>These springs eventually dried up, and the
              Jawas adapted to their new environment with
              sheer ingenuity. To protect themselves from the
              fierce double suns of their world, they started
              wearing coarse, homespun cloaks
              with large hoods under
              which only their yellow, glowing eyes seem
              to be visible. Their eyes
              are magnified by polished orange gemstones embedded in their facial
              coverings to protect their sensitive rat-like
              vision from the bright sunlight. These gems,
              called durindfire, are found in the desert
              sands and are worthless to other species—but
              the Jawas find them invaluable.</p>
            <p>For their own nourishment, Jawas obtain water
              by inserting long, thin hoses down the stems of
              the funnel flower, a flora native to Tatooine, and
              siphoning off the liquid. Their diet is primarily
              made up of hubba gourd, a fruit difficult for
              humans to digest, the name of which in
              the Jawas’ language translates to
              “the staff of life.</p>
            <p>Most humans have noted that
              Jawas give off a strong, distinct, and
              usually unpleasant odor. This is the
              combined result of a mysterious solution in which they dip their clothes to retain body moisture,
              and the fact that they do not bathe often in their water-bereft
              environment. It is also partly related to their communication
              methods, half of which are pheromonal projections.</p>

          <div class="card-body">
            <p>Jawa society is divided into clans or tribes.
              Once a year, all the clans will meet at a giant
              gathering in the great basin of the Dune Sea,
              where they share stories, trade items, and even
              barter sons and daughters as “marriage merchandise.
              ” The trading of family members in
              marriage is considered a good business deal,
              as it continues the diversity of their bloodlines.
              In fact, Jawa culture centers on family. They
              take immense pride in their clans and ancestry, and their
              language includes forty-three different terms to describe relationship, lineage, and bloodline. Clans keep
              track of these relations very closely, recording family lines with extreme
              detail. Few Jawas leave the clan lifestyle, and when they
              do, they can be found in disreputable Tatooine cities such
              as Mos Eisley and Mos Espa. Members of the clans travel
              together in large vehicles known as sandcrawlers—nuclear fusion-powered ore-hauling vehicles abandoned by
              contractors during the reign of the Old Republic. Jawas have
              modified these sandcrawlers to the point that their original
              purpose is virtually undetectable. Each crawler carries up
              to three hundred Jawas and acts as a fully equipped repair shop, allowing them to perform skilled
              reconstructions as
              they make their journey across the desert wastes.</p>
            <p>To make their living, Jawas salvage, repair,
              and resell junk that they find in the desert.
              Sometimes they even “find” items that haven’t
              been lost, especially those that haven’t been
              locked down. Moisture farmers often discover
              their property disappearing, only for it to turn
              up in the possession of a Jawa who is selling
              it at a tidy profit. Because of this, they are reputed to be swindlers and thieves, but Jawas
              are not offended by the accusation and are instead proud of their ability to discover items
              that others “lose,” and also proud of their proficiency at repairing equipment. For junk that
              is unsalvageable, Jawas utilize high-powered
              solar smelters that melt things down into salable ingots.</p>
            <p>While a portion of the Jawas are constantly on the move,
              searching for salvage, the remainder stay behind in clan
              fortresses built from large chunks of wrecked spacecraft.
              Master repair experts reside in these fortresses, where they
              perform advanced salvage procedures that exceed the capacity of the sandcrawler shops. These elaborate
              fortifications are often subjected to attacks by Sand People, who will
              kill Jawas in order to pillage their scavenged treasures and precious water. This is one of many harsh
              desert realities that contribute greatly to Jawas’ cautious, almost paranoid, nature, and as such they
              have made their defense into their best offense,
              through the stability of the fortresses they
              build. Jawas are not intense fighters, and because of their size, they’ll often run away when
              confronted. When cornered, however, Jawas
              have proven themselves to be very resourceful and capable users of the weapons that they
              scavenge from the desert sands.</p>

            <p>A vast yellow globe baking in the heat of its twin suns, <b>Tatooine</b> was mistaken for a star by early explorers of the Outer Rim—and in 
              the scorching heat of high noon, locals joke that those explorers weren’t so wrong. Life on Tatooine is a study in perseverance, but
              despite the inhospitable conditions, there is life here. Jawas, hooded rodent-like scavengers, scour Tatooine’s wastes for scrap they can
              salvage. Primitive desert warriors called Tusken Raiders wander the desert, abiding by ancient tribal traditions. Herds of eopies root for
              buried lichen, rock warts hunt for prey, and an unlucky traveler may hear the booming cries of the semi-legendary krayt dragon. And
              there are more recent arrivals: humans, Hutts, and all manner of spacefaring species.</p>
            <p>Despite what bored young moisture farmers might tell you, Tatooine is fairly well known in the galaxy. The system sits at a juncture
              ofhyperspace routes: The Triellus Trade Route connects Hutt Space with a sizable chunk ofthe Outer Rim, while a loop ofthe Corellian
              Run sees traffic running to and from the Core Worlds. Space battles were common over Tatooine long before the planet’s settlement, and
              today Tatooine’s spaceports continue to thrive.</p>

              cannot be learned by humans and other species. While Jawas

              it or any language other than their own, and thus, to trade

            <p>The most prominent member of each clan
              is the shaman, a female Jawa whom the population believes possesses the ability to predict
              the future. While this has not been scientifically
              proven, recently discovered studies of the Jawas
              performed before the ascension of Emperor
              Palpatine assert that these female shamans
              exhibited something akin to Force abilities. Unlike any Jedi, however, they perform elaborate
              spells, hexes, and blessings to protect the tribe
              and provide wellness for its members. Each
              shaman takes on a student during her tenure,
              training this apprentice to take her place when
              she dies.</p>
            <p>The clan shaman, through her influence, controls most tribal decisions relating to defenses,
              travel, and day-to-day life. She does not travel
              in the sandcrawler, but remains behind at the permanent
              fortress, where she can be better protected. In fact, Jawas
              will fight to defend the shaman even in the face of certain
              defeat. In his notes, anthropologist Hoole referred to an incident where he witnessed Jawas defending the
              shaman’s
              home against a force of Tusken Raiders with the ferocity of
              beings twice their size. They did not retreat or surrender,
              though nearly three-quarters of the Jawas lost their lives in
              the process.</p>
