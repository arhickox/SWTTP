    <p>Native to the planet Zolan in the Mid Rim, <b>Clawdites</b> are primarily known across the rest of the galaxy for
      their innate ability to transform their appearance. This knack grants the species a value to the larger galaxy that
      far exceeds any of their homeworld’s other exports—to the chagrin of many Clawdites, some of whom feel that their species’
      cultural and techno­ logical contributions to galactic culture are ignored because of the fixation on their very peculiar
      genetic ability. Because of their shape-changing talents, Clawdites remain in high demand for careers focused upon
      deception, including espionage and other, even less savory pursuits. Their natural abilities and scar­ city give members
      of the species legendary status as spies and informants. Rumors of a Clawdite’s presence naturally alert guilty parties
      to be more vigilant, while a crime lord who retains a Clawdite’s services gains prestige through the hire.</p>

            <p>Clawdites are a humanoid species with reptilian traits. In their default forms, their skin has a rough texture
              that typically ranges in color from pale yellow to dark green. The pupils of their large eyes are slitted,
              with irises that range in color from yellow to deep blue. However, many galactic citizens who interact with
              Clawdites never actually see this form, or even know that they are dealing with a Clawdite. Some Clawdites
              create a single preferred guise that they use for their public dealings, never showing their true form. This
              has various advantages, from throwing potential enemies off guard when they reveal them­ selves to keeping
              suspicion that they might be an infiltrator to a minimum. After all, when people know there is a Clawdite around,
              they tend to be more cautious. On the other hand, some Clawdites use this to their advantage by openly displaying
              their true forms, to remind everyone of their unique ability—especially when that ability is an asset to the
              job at hand. Those Clawdites who do not rely upon their shapeshifting for professional reasons tend to remain
              in their default state around others to help reassure them that they are acting in good faith. These practices
              vary by individual and the expectations of the company that they currently keep.</p>
            <p>Clawdites have two inherent physiological traits that enable their shape-changing. The first is the particularly
              sophisticated chromatophores that exist within their skin cells. These enable them to change their skin tone
              at will, and Clawdites with sufficient practice can match nearly any color that their eyes can perceive. The
              second is the capacity to control aspects of their lymphatic system consciously and with great precision. Using
              this control, a trained Clawdite can physically shrink and grow parts of their body, stretching their skin
              to take on different shapes. Replicating a specific appearance in this way requires practice.</p>
            <p>Because Clawdites depend upon their body’s internal abilities to shape-change, they cannot alter their mass
              in the process. This means that they can make minor alterations to their size based on their density, but they
              cannot substantially grow or shrink. Their humanoid anatomy also prevents them from relocating organs, except
              in superficial ways. To help offset this limitation, some Clawdites wear an automated saline pump. This enables
              them to adjust the amount of fluid within their bodies, increasing their ability to change their size within
              a limited range.</p>

            <p>Clawdites have a particularly strong inclination toward individualism, and many have a difficult time forming
              close bonds, even—or especially—with members of their own species. This is in part because of the mutability
              of their appearance. A trusted con­ tact could vanish with a shared resource, or a deceitful individual could
              easily assume another’s identity. As a consequence, their society on Zolan has developed various measures to
              verify identities. Political and social organizations depend upon high levels of redundancy, and records are
              maintained in the open so that individuals can freely validate one another’s work. Nevertheless, personal responsibility
              and accountability have remained challenging principles to enforce across Clawdite history. Most Clawdites
              are guarded even when greeting familiar individuals, and rely on conversational cues and personality traits
              far more than physical appearance to verify identity.</p>
            <p>Clawdites’ entrance onto the galactic stage at large had a substantial impact on how they viewed their ability.
              Their unique shapeshifting trait made Clawdites the perfect spies, and many were hired to work offworld by
              governments, criminal their culture and how syndicates, and military organizations. Now, Clawdites are found
              all across the Outer Rim—though some Clawdites live in secret, preferring that their acquaintances not know
              their true species, lest they distrust them for it or worse, try to exploit it.</p>

            <p><b>Zolan</b> is a warm and arid world, located near the Corellian Run. During the development of the Clawdite
              species, a spike in solar activity bathed the world in radiation. The Clawdite’s ability to modify their skin
              color and body shape was one of many adaptations that resulted from this massive change in Zolan’s climate.
              The predatory monzu and numerous other species from Zolan share this trait, though many species developed different
              means of surviving despite the ongoing radiation bombardment. As with any event that disrupts a period of evolutionary
              stasis, most of Zolan’s lifeforms were unable to cope with the heightened radiation and died off precipitously,
              and those that remained dramatically shaped by it.</p>
            <p>Zolan’s radiation levels eventually reverted to a more survivable level, as its star completed its extreme
              radia­tion emission cycle. Traits developed to survive this catastrophe were turned to new ends, resulting
              in a number of species that could change their physiology as well as others with thick bony plating to protect
              against radiation. Beyond that, the extinction event reshaped Zolan. Large portions of the planet became desolate
              wastelands. Most of the plants and animals that had once dwelt there were eliminated, and new life forms only
              slowly encroached on the most devastated regions.</p>
            <p>This planetary transformation had serious reper­cussions on the world’s environment, as well as its ability
              to provide for the Clawdite population. In fact, the resultant scarcity of resources very likely contrib­uted
              to the cautious and self-reliant nature of Clawd­ite society as it developed.</p>

              many other Clawdites work as Explorers, Technicians, or in specialized Colonist roles. Many Clawdites who originally

            <p>A Clawdite’s natural appearance is easily recognized, particularly among those who regularly work within the
              galaxy’s dark under­ belly. Crime lords who hire a Clawdite are very proud that they have a shape-changer in
              their employ. The species is uncommon, and having a loyal Clawdite as a member of an organization carries a
              level of prestige. Further, most syndicate leaders believe that their allies recognize the Clawdite could be
              impersonating anyone in any situation. This can be a strong motivator for a more honest relationship, at least
              on the part of their allies. For a Clawdite PC, such expectations can represent an opportunity or a challenge.
              A Clawdite who does engage in various forms of skulduggery might enjoy having employers pay more for her work,
              while one who is engaged in honest trade may be frustrated by clients’ unfounded worries that anyone they meet
              could be the Clawdite in disguise. To help alleviate such concerns (even if they are unfair), some Clawdites
              teach their friends and business partners how to identify them by their behavior and manner­ isms rather than
              just their looks, as Clawdites generally do with other Clawdites they know.</p>
