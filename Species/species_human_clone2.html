    <p>As the Clone Wars drag on, the stress of combat and
      the high casualties cause cracks and strains in the
      ranks of the <b>clone</b> soldiers. Personality quirks, once
      considered harmless or even essential to the mental
      development of these soldiers, now express themselves 
      in extreme and polarizing ways.</p>
    <p>Naive new clones, fresh from the clone tanks, find
      themselves fighting alongside veterans who have
      experienced years of combat, the deaths of comrades,
      objectives gained or failed, and the often-ineffectual
      civilian Republic leadership. Some veterans have
      developed a skepticism of Republic bureaucracy that
      shocks even the most cynical of rookie clones.</p>
    <p>Though the vast majority of clones remain loyal to
      the Republic, a small number have begun to question
      their strict obedience. Unlike most “natural” species,
      in which the youth question their elders, it is the older
      clones of the Grand Army of the Republic who find
      themselves questioning their values and traditions.
      These clones still find meaning in service and comfort
      in the company of their brothers, but life no longer
      seems as cut and dry as it did at the start of the war.</p>

            <p>Clones are physically identical, based on

              They share his black hair, dark-brown eye color, and
              light-brown skin tone. Insufficient or rushed field care
              has left most veterans with deep physical scars. These
              soldiers wear their scars with pride, and some even
              refuse rehabilitative treatment to remove them, even
              when the Republic can spare the resources for such

            <p>The soldiers of the Grand Army consider
              their brothers-in-arms to be their family, bonding
              most closely with their immediate squad mates. They
              fight for their brothers, die for their brothers, and support their brothers. While admirable, this quality also
              can keep them from seeing the bigger picture and can
              make them willfully ignorant of the Republic’s politics.</p>
            <p>After the intense conflict of the war so far, the
              clones’ minor personality quirks have been amplified
              by constant battle and sustained stress. Each unit has
              its own rituals, small ways to identify squad mates,
              those from the same company. Veterans of specific
              campaigns often do likewise. A soldier who talks about
              “cracking that crystal” identifies himself as a veteran
              of Christophsis and the assault on Crystal City, while
              an officer calling targets “bugs” reveals he fought in
              the hives on Geonosis. Clones respect a fellow soldier
              with a different background, but may feel separated
              by time, space, and the unique aspects of his struggle.</p>
            <p>On their off hours, the clones continue their training,
              but for their mental health, command has given them
              permission to pursue hobbies, within limited parameters. This has improved morale and recovery, but has
              also given them insight into how the “other side,” the
              civilian side, lives. These differences continue to highlight the clones’ place in the universe. Non-clones can
              go home to their families. Jedi can return to the temple for thoughtful contemplation. When the war ends,
              the Republic intends to retire them, but neither the
              government nor the clones know what that means.

              study under the soft white lights of the clone facilities,

            <p>Still, from the moment of their birth, clones receive
              encouragement from their trainers and genetic engineers to leave Kamino, to be soldiers among the stars.

            <p>Clones talk about retirement
              as a reward for their service in the war, but few know
              what that entails. When a soldier brings the subject
              up, their commander quickly puts an end to the idle
              chatter to focus on immediate mission objectives. A
              few commanders and forward-looking clones have
              contemplated work in corporate security or consulta￾tion with local militaries. However, their loyalty to the

            <p>Some hints may reveal the clones’ futures. A minute
              few have deserted, seeking lives away from war and
              combat. Politicians have vetted certain officers about
              staying in a formalized and permanent Republic military to maintain the peace, and a few exceptional
              clones have been approached with the idea of their
              own run for office. They have proven their loyalty to
              the Republic, and the civilian populace loves military
              heroes. If only the clones didn’t have such disdain for
              politicking, they could be ideal candidates.</p>

            <p>The clones suffer a decade’s worth of painful accelerated growth before they reach
              maturity. Meanwhile, they endure nonstop
              training, simulations, and testing. Though
              encouraged to identify with their cohort, they
              receive no time to form friendships beyond a
              soldier’s bond. Throughout their growth and
              training, the clones receive letter and number
              designations to eliminate any sense of individuality. The cloners and trainers on Kamino
              treat them as pieces of a machine, not people.</p>
            <p>The endless mental and physical drills bleed
              into their “recreation,
              ” where they participate
              in sports and games that resemble battle
              simulations. The inevitable bouts of anger and
              rebellion get treated over time in retraining
              pods, essentially isolation tanks. Throughout
              clones’ time on Kamino, their engineers mutter
              veiled threats of disposal if the clones fail their
              testing. The Jedi have clamped down on the
              more egregious attitudes, but the engineers of
              Kamino still treat the clones as a product.
