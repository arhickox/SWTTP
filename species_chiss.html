            <p>Near-humans with dark-blue skin and glowing red eyes, the Chiss tend to run to the tall side of the human
              body type. Their skin color and eyes grow more intense the greater concentration of oxygen they are in. On
              average, Chiss tend to be more physically fit and overall more attractive than regular humans, assuming one
              is not thrown off by the skin and eyes. Their hair is universally jet black, save for the silvering found in
              those of advanced age.</p>
            <p>Genetic analysis reveals that the Chiss are an offshoot of humanity, most likely dating back to the earliest
              eras of expansionism. Millennia of subterranean living altered their biology considerably. Not only did it
              result in the shift of their appearance from standard human but also their greater strength, endurance, and
              other physical qualities over baseline humans. They also reach physical maturity much more rapidly; most are
              physically and emotionally mature by their early teens, and on average, Chiss live about 80 standard years.</p>

              the Chiss have generally kept to themselves as a civilization

              as superior. Art, culture, intellectual advancement, and
              discipline are highly prized qualities among the Chiss,
              and they have worked hard to build a society that relies
              not upon economic achievement but upon personal
              growth and contributions to the society as a whole.</p>
            <p>Those Chiss that do venture into the galaxy at large do
              so generally with a profound respect for their peoples'
              desire to remain apart from the Empire and its struggles.
              Few beings outside of the Chiss even know where the
              Ascendancy is, which is the preferred state of affairs for
              them. Individual Chiss see the chance for great personal
              growth among the stars, as well as a chance to learn
              many things they can take back to their people.</p>

              a full-bore ice age nearly 5,000 years ago. Glaciers

              are biologically connected to and similar to humans
              in most ways, they possess certain variances in their
              vocal apparatus that permit sounds and textures to
              their speech that make for a language many other
              species find strangely beautiful to hear. The structure
              of the language, steeped in context-derived combinations
              of words for idea expression, as well as the
              unique nature of Chiss vocal abilities, necessitated
              their adoption of trade languages. Sy Bisti and Minnisiat

          <p>Chiss are known for their patience and tactical
            aptitude, always acting with their opponent's
            next move (or three) in mind. In the
            Academy and Aristocra, youths are taught to
            painstakingly analyze the situation in order to
            formulate the most precise and effective response.
            This has resulted in a cultural taboo
            against preemptive strikes, so much so that an
            unprovoked advance during conflicts and war
            can result in exile from the Ascendency.</p>
          <p>A player could role-play this tendency either
            way. An archetypical Chiss might wait until the
            very last moment to draw his blaster, ensuring
            that all possible alternatives are exhausted before
            resorting to violence. On the other hand,
            a rebellious or unorthodox Chiss may leverage
            the stereotype to his advantage, striking first
            when his opponent least expects it.</p>
