    <p><b>Melittos</b> are insectile, chitin-plated bipeds who hail from the volcanic Inner Rim planet of Li-Toran. Lacking
      eyes, they rely on auditory organs and feathery cilia to sense their surroundings. The cilia cover their bodies, allowing
      them to detect vibrations, scents, and even electrical fields. Through powerful scent-memories, Melittos can identify
      and track specific targets and penetrate clever disguises. They can even sense the chemical compounds that identify
      diseases, making them gifted natural physicians. Many Melittos use their abilities to become renowned bounty hunters
      or trackers.</p>
    <p>Nearly all Melittos live in densely packed underground hives, although a few exist outside of hive society. Most of
      the latter, known as ronin, leave their homeworld to travel the galaxy. Some of them find new purpose in contributing
      to the Alliance via their rare abilities.</p>

            <p>Melittos are cold-blooded, preferring hot climates whenever possible. Newborns lack the species’ distinctive
              chitin scales, which grow as they mature, making it possible to judge age by the number, size, and condition
              of the plates. Melittos’ cilia also grow with age, beginning as brightly hued strands and becoming less colorful
              over the years. Chitin and cilia coloration indicates a Melitto’s hive of origin, though the sightless Melittos
              rely on individual scent-memories for this information.</p>
            <p>Melittos can only digest sugary liquids. Their diet consists primarily of the crimson sap from a native coral-like
              organism known as bleeding rock, which grows in the thick steam within Li-Toran’s underground tunnels. The
              air in the tunnels contains much higher densities of toxic compounds than the world’s already dangerous surface
              atmosphere. As the Melittos evolved in this harsh environment, their very survival depends on these toxins.
              When offworld, they must wear a special survival device that lets them breathe the same compounds; the device
              also distills local foodstuffs into sweet-smelling liquids that simulate bleeding-rock sap.</p>

            <p>Melittos live in caste-based hives, each controlled by a single queen, who is supported by younger females
              known as myrmitrices. Queens and myrmitrices emit special pheromones that control the males, who are called
              myrmites. The myrmites make up the majority of the population and perform almost all hive activities, including
              combat, maintenance, and, most importantly, agriculture.</p>
            <p>Hive society is built around tending bleeding-rock coral farms and harvesting the highly nutritious red sap
              the coral produces. This is a difficult process, and poor harvests can rapidly lead to population pressures.
              Thus, when a hive becomes too large to operate given its food supply, groups of myrmitrices and their myrmite
              followers soon leave, either voluntarily or forcibly. The exiles create a new hive in another underground region,
              and soon the myrmitrices vie to become its new queen in a deadly struggle. The victorious myrmitrix and her
              myrmites take control of the new hive. Surviving myrmites belonging to defeated myrmitrices become hiveless
              ronin, most of whom leave Li-Toran for new lives. Some seek out organizations on other worlds to act as surrogate
              hives for them, while others strike out on their own and become independent agents.</p>

            <p><b>Li-Toran</b> is a harsh world of violent storms. The intense volcanic activity creates dark, noxious clouds
              that let almost no light pierce through to the ground. These factors have made the planet extremely hot and
              unpleasant to outsiders. Rivers of molten rock carve complex networks of constantly shifting tunnels through
              the crust, where most of the native flora and fauna evolved. Many of the tunnels expand into huge caverns,
              some kilometers in size, where Melittos make their hives.</p>
            <p>On the surface, the Empire has a garrison named Dometown to monitor the population. The posting has become
              somewhat of a punishment detail due to the dangerous conditions; stormtroopers here sometimes refer to it as
              Doomtown. Traveling elsewhere on the planet (or rather, below its surface) demands heavy environmental suits

              where the conditions would be fatal to others. Such practices have led to a growing hatred for the Empire among

            <p>Long before the fall of the Republic, there was a time in Melitto history known as the Unending Conflict.
              Overdevelopment had left few viable locations for new hives, causing myrmitrices to compete for the same caverns.
              Worse, before any conflict could end, new myrmitrices with fresh soldier-myrmites would join the battle and
              continue the violence. For centuries, this escalated until the level of underground warfare caused whole tunnel
              and cavern networks to collapse. To prevent all-out catastrophe, the largest hives formed a planetary council
              to end the existing battles and work to ensure such wars were not repeated. One part of its solution was to
              begin colonization efforts, sending myrmitrices and their myrmites to neighboring systems.</p>
