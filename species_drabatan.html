    <p>Music-obsessed amphibious humanoids, <b>Drabatans</b> come from the freshwater swamps of Pipada. Drabatans are renowned
      performers, often touring the galaxy on the strength of their skills. Their passionate nature includes a penchant for
      protest, which resulted in disaster when criti￾cism of the Emperor went too far. Imperial reprisals since have been
      harsh.

            <p>Drabatans are amphibious humanoids with grey-green skin, small dark eyes, and a massive mouth. They stand
              slightly shorter than humans. They are excellent swimmers (though they strongly dislike salt water) and dine
              on a variety of insects, fish, and algae. To reproduce, Drabatans lay eggs that hatch tadpoles in silty pond
              soil. Over the course of a year, the tadpoles grow and assume bipedal features before emerging as child-sized
              Drabatans. They also develop large lungs and strong diaphragms, which enable them to achieve powerful vocals
              while singing or shouting.

            <p>Drabatans are a passionate species dedicated to the performing arts, especially song. Critics describe their
              music as hauntingly beautiful and insist that Drabatan music requires no translation for anyone to appreciate
              the ethereal, melancholy tones. Performance troupes throughout the galaxy, particularly Rodian Theater and
              Mon Cala Opera troupes, count Drabatans, who often play the heel, among their number. Drabatan voices are pitch-perfect,
              and many beings consider seeing a live performance of the Pipada Symphony Chamber Chorus to be life changing.</p>
            <p>Song is firmly entrenched throughout everyday Drabatan life, in areas ranging from entertainment to education.
              Drabatan families have unique songs that detail their lineage and history, often performed at gatherings by
              the family’s best vocalist and rearranged for the occasion. School curriculums teach everything through song,
              and students use jingles as mnemonic devices to help with memorization.</p>
            <p>Drabatan culture values free artistic expression and opposes censorship. It is said that the only thing a
              Drabatan likes more than a song is a cause; Drabatans can be found at protest marches across the galaxy, often
              leading chants. Their political views have aligned them ideologically with Alderaan and Chandrila, which has
              created tension under Imperial rule.</p>

              in trees, perched on stilts, or floating in ponds. The largest lakes host cities featuring massive towers with
              foundations plunging deep into the lakebed. Some of the towers support luxurious skyhooks. Anchored to downtown
              towers are endless strings of bobbing buoy-buildings housing a variety of shops. The area beneath the lake
              surface is just as busy as that above, and most buildings have entrances both above and below the water.</p>

              as sonic volume determines much of the subtext and grammar. When necessary, Drabatans have a simpler, quieter
              language that utilizes their vocal pouches to emit croaks of varying pitch. Drabatans can also speak Basic

            <p>Pipada evaded conflict during the Clone Wars, but its final outcome had a lasting impact on Drabatan society.
              When the Galactic Empire came to power, the Drabatans protested. A young singer named Sa’Kalla, who was among
              the most vocal opponents of the New Order, wrote popular protest songs condemning Imperial tyranny. It wasn’t
              long before the Empire heard them—and responded.</p>
            <p>The Empire blockaded Pipada and deployed garrisons of specialized swamptroopers to the surface. Protests turned
              into massacres, and the Empire captured Sa’Kalla. While she was in captivity, a movement organized in Sa’Kalla’s
              name spread across the planet. When the violence threatened to overwhelm Imperial forces, the Imperial Governor
              brought Sa’Kalla out to the Pipada Auditorium in front of half a million Drabatans. Smug in its belief that
              torture had broken her, the Empire ordered Sa’Kalla to convince her people to submit to Imperial rule. Instead,
              Sa’Kalla shouted for her people to resist, and was immediately killed on stage.</p>
            <p>The entire stadium erupted, and enraged locals tore Imperial security to shreds. The Drabatans briefly reclaimed
              their homeworld, and many fled offworld. The Empire soon returned with reinforce￾ments and imposed martial
              law across Pipada. Drabatans still resist, in ways big and small, and those who fight shout a war cry as they
              charge into battle: “Sa’Kalla!”</p>
