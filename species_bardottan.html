    <p><b>Bardottans</b> are characteristically intelligent and deeply spiritual, and many demonstrate high levels of physical skill
      as well. They are often scholars, devoting their lives to the intense study of a specific field. Many travel the galaxy
      in pursuit of their research. Academic Bardottans typically only continue a journey after they have uncovered all information
      in their current location that is relevant to their research. As they study, Bardottans tend to meditate as a key component
      of the learning process. Often, these meditations include reflections upon history, family, and their cultural interpretation
      of the Force.</p>

            <p>Bardottans are a saurian species, with scaled skin. Their lower legs bend backward, and they walk on three-toed
              feet. Their forearms are shorter than their lower extremities and end in three fingers and a thumb. Their long
              necks are heavily wrinkled and can bend in any direction. A beak-like snout dominates their head. Bardottans
              vary substantially in height at maturity, ranging from just over a meter to more than two meters tall. Their
              skin tones range from pale gray to yellow, green, and even purple. Some have a consistent tone across their
              bodies, but others have distinctive markings, including striped and spotted patterns.</p>

            <p>Bardottan culture traditionally values knowledge and education very highly, and cultivates an intense devotion
              to spiritual matters. Bardottan scholars tend toward a high degree of secrecy with the information that they
              uncover in the course of their research, only sharing details with outsiders when it becomes absolutely necessary.
              They are proud and independent beings who are reluctant to ask for assistance. Instead, they prefer to resolve
              issues internally whenever possible. They expect outside intervention only when situations become particularly
              dire.
            </p>
            <p>Bardottans deliberately isolate their society into groups within different academic and religious fields.
              Because they consider all information precious, earning the right to information is a part of their educational
              and professional process. They become quite loyal to their immediate peers, but they are reluctant to work
              with those outside of their group.</p>

            <p>After their exposure to the larger galaxy millennia ago, Bardottans colonized other worlds, including Phu.

          <p>The Bardottans have a strong cultural Force tradition, whose skilled practitioners are known as the Dagoyan
            Masters. This tradition links the Force to the idea of living in harmony with the galaxy. The Dagoyan Masters
            use the Force as a tool for education and understanding, sometimes integrating its use into negotiations. They
            are nonviolent, believing that the Force should never be used to injure another living being.</p>
          <p>Bardotta is also home to the hidden Frangawl cult. This order embraces the dark side of the Force in the worship
            of an ancient demon named Malmourral. The Frangawl cult willingly employed violence in their traditions, even
            going so far as to extract the Living Force from their victims so that they could sacrifice it as part of their
            rituals.
          </p>
          <p>Bardottans are opposed to the Jedi tradition of taking younglings to Jedi Temples for training. The Dagoyan
            Masters believe that any Force-sensitive members of their species should join the Bardottan tradition. This led
            to a conflict of interest with the Jedi, in which the Bardottan government labeled them as kidnappers.</p>

          <p>The Bardottans are a proud species. While they hold themselves and others to a very high standard, they are
            uncomfortable admitting to those times when they have failed to live up to that standard. Bardottans recognize
            that their culture has gone through growing pains, as most do. However, they have tried to conceal these mistakes
            from the greater galaxy rather than using them as an example from which others could learn.</p>
          <p>The Frangawl cult is a tragic example. In their shame, the Bardottans have tried to ignore the cult’s existence,
            even as cultists have kidnapped and sacrificed important citizens. Because of the Bardottans’ degree of sophistication,
            these incidents have been rare, but they remain deplorable.</p>
