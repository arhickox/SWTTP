    <p>Few predators in the galaxy can rival the <b>Sakiyans</b>. As trackers, they are matched only by the Gand. As hunters, they
      are the equal of the Trandoshans and Defel. As killers, they are virtually unparalleled. Fortunately for the rest of
      the galaxy, Sakiyans tend to have very little interest in anything beyond their own star system and rarely venture
      far from their homeworld.</p>
    <p>Although the Sakiyans’ hunting prowess would seem to make them better suited for ground-level living, an entire segment
      of Sakiyan society has moved above their traditional forest encampments to grand and lofty repulsorlift cities. There,
      the Sakiyans’ best and brightest minds have continued to develop and perfect their repulsorlift technology, which they
      export across the galaxy. It is this expertise that has allowed them to resist multiple attempted conquests over the
      years.
    </p>
    <p>Sakiyans are renowned as bounty hunters and assassins; those who leave their homeworld, Saki, find their skills in
      high demand among the Hutt kajidics. Yet, there is no love lost between the proud Sakiyans and the Hutts, who would
      dominate them and their homeworld given half the chance.</p>

            <p>Though superficially similar to humans, Sakiyans are a distinct species, having evolved along convergent lines
              but possessing various notable features. Most visibly, Sakiyans have enlarged, bifurcated craniums, lack any
              hair, and have pointed ears. Their skin is highly reflective, like burnished metal, and varies in color from
              jet black and dark grey to varying shades of red, blue, and purple. Pale-skinned and albino Sakiyans exist
              as well. Nearly twice the size of the average human brain, the highly evolved brains of the Sakiyans are able
              to process impressive amounts of sensory information. As such, Sakiyans have extraordinary senses: they are
              able to see into the infrared spectrum and possess truly exceptional hearing and smell. Some Sakiyan hunters
              are said to track their prey by smell alone.</p>

            <p>Sakiyan society is organized around complex family and clan relationships. Known as prides, Sakiyan clans
              form the basis of their communities. Protecting and defending their families and prides are the overriding
              concerns of members of the species. As such, Sakiyans tend to be territorial and suspicious of strangers and
              outsiders, especially non-Sakiyans. The prides are largely homogenous, relatively insulated groups, and pride
              leaders exercise familial and political authority over their clans and communities. Sakiyan skin tones are
              one means by which prides identify themselves, though there is little overt prejudice based on skin color between
              most groups. The notable exception to this is the bigotry directed against light-skinned Sakiyans, who are
              generally viewed as aberrations by the rest of Sakiyan society, even their own kin. Because of this, paleskinned
              and albino Sakiyans are more likely than others to leave Saki and forge their own paths in the galaxy</p>
            <p>Predators at their core, Sakiyans take great pleasure in the hunt and regard hunting as the truest test of
              a being’s worth. They tend to view themselves as the ultimate hunters—with some justification—and regard most
              other species as little more than cud-chewing prey, barely worthy of the most minimal respect. Sakiyans are
              also noted for their distinct lack of humor as well as their intellectual and problem-solving abilities; they
              rarely take kindly to being proven wrong.</p>

          <p>akiyans take honor seriously. They divide honor into two types, <i>monthrcel</i>— personal honor— and <i>yithrcel</i>— pride
            honor. <i>Monthrcel</i>, a Sakiyan’s individual honor, can be lost or redeemed only via personal deeds. If a Sakiyan
            incurs dishonor by cowardice or failing to protect his family, such a stain can only be removed by his own actions.
            Dying with a black mark on one's personal honor is one of the greatest tragedies for a Sakiyan.</p>
          <p><i>Yithrcel</i>, on the other hand, is the honor of a Sakiyan’s pride or clan. A significant blemish on one’s
            personal honor can bring shame to a Sakiyan’s entire pride. While personal honor can only be reclaimed by the
            individual, yithrcel can be recovered by the children and descendants of a Sakiyan who disgraced the clan. Very
            often, the strict Sakiyan code of honor requires the spilling of blood. Honor duels and feuds are common, and
            vendettas are passed down through many generations.</p>
          <p>For such a prideful and warlike people, every passing slight or disagreement could potentially lead to violence
            and bloodshed. Fortunately, their formalized honor rituals also help restrain their passions. The honor system
            imposes an almost inviolable code of conduct that prevents them from acting too impulsively for fear of incurring
            dishonor. Of course, Sakiyans do not normally attribute honor to other species, and they rarely apply their normal
            rules of conduct to dealings with humans and other aliens.</p>
