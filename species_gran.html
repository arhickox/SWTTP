    <p>The humanoid, three-eyed <b>Gran</b> are a familiar sight throughout the galaxy. Frequenting trade routes and spaceports,
      traveling in groups as merchants or tourists, the Gran seem to be everywhere. While they can hold their own if forced
      to fight, these self-proclaimed pacifists are natural talkers. Whether Gran are friendly and open or cunning and manipulative,
      they boast well-honed social skills. They have a knack for learning information that their source does not mean to
      give. At some point, most travelers have been the victim of a Gran's friendly barrage of questioning.</p>
    <p>The Gran have a strong community spirit and work cooperatively for the good of all. They have evolved from peaceful
      herbivores; on their homeworld of Kinyen they were once the hunted rather than hunter, living in large groups for protection.
      However, the Gran have adapted since they took to the stars, sometimes even becoming hunters themselves, taking work
      as hired guns or bounty hunters.</p>
    <p>There are colonies of Gran in many different sectors, as the species has dispersed throughout the galaxy quickly and
      enthusiastically. The most significant of their colonies are those on Hok and Malastare, where the local Gran regard
      themselves as natives. The Gran of these colonies have developed different social codes and practices to those still
      on Kinyen, who consider them only genetically similar. Colonies of Gran away from their homeworld are unlikely to remain
      a microcosm of Kinyen for long, even if they begin that way.</p>

            <p>As a species, Gran are socialists and staunch pacifists, but not all individual Gran practice what their society
              preaches. Gran have a strong sense of community, and on Kinyen they raise their children for specific careers
              in order to benefit the community as a whole. This means that while the Gran are not unintelligent, their education
              can be somewhat limited. The Gran once lived in herds, relying on their numbers for safety. Now, Gran depend
              on their kin emotionally and hate solitude. In fact, loneliness can drive them insane, often criminally so.The
              harshest punishment for a Gran is exile, since having to leave his family and friends forever is a fate worse
              than death.</p>
            <p>While most Gran accept the practicalities of their educational system, there are always exceptions.The occasional
              Gran may find the structure too rigid, and want to leave the planet to do something other than the role assigned
              to him.</p>

              which is one reason the Gran have spread so far through the galaxy. Many Gran still live in the colorful cities
              of their homeworld, which delight their keen sense of sight. The planet boasts lush forests as well as large
              plains of goatgrass, a favorite food of the Gran.</p>

          <p>While not as prevalent as humans, Gran are almost as versatile. Their abilitytoadapt and make homesand lives
            for themselves wherever they end up makes them successful colonists. Gran who travel the stars by choice, and
            many of them do, often do very well for themselves. Their amiable natures allow them to live easily alongside
            other species, and their positive outlook can make even the most barren of rocks seem like home. Some Gran even
            travel alone, but are only content to do so as long as they meet plenty of other sentient beings along the way.</p>
          <p>Gran from Kinyen, who are generally peaceful, fight when necessary to protect themselves. On the fringe, where
            their lives and circumstances are very different, violent Gran are not uncommon. Some Gran do not travel by
            choice, but exile compels them to do so. These mutants and criminals of their homeworld often turn to drink or
            spice to forget their troubles, and to crime to fund these vices.</p>

          <p>Although the Gran species originated on Kinyen, there are now many Gran who think of Malastare as their homeworld.
            Their history is quite different, and more turbulent, than that of their relatives on Kinyen.</p>
          <p>Once Malastare became part of the Hydian Way, it became a key planet for trading and attracted many visitors,
            including some Gran colonists. For these Gran, Malastare was a bustling and lucrative planet where they could
            make a living and meet many spacefaring species without even leaving their new home. However, until their arrival,
            the sole sentient native species of Malastare had been the Dugs. The Dugs did not take kindly to what they saw
            as an invasion. Unfortunately for them, the Gran settlers had the support of the Republic, while the Dugs did
            not. War ensued, from which the Gran emerged thevictors.</p>
          <p>Eventually the Gran population on Malastare exceeded that of the Dugs, who became subservient to their conquerors.
            The principles of Gran on Kinyen meant they could not approve of the apparent slavery of the Dugs, or the war
            that had been necessary for the colonists. They consider the Gran of Malastare to be almost a different species.</p>
