    <p>With a cultural outlook that some consider simple or transcendent, the <b>Gand</b>, an insectoid species, enjoy a
      deep and complicated culture. Their emotional steadiness and (apparent) humility should make the members of this species
      natural disciples of the Force. However, it takes a specific kind of ambition to walk the Jedi path.</p>

            <p>The Gand compromise numerous subspecies. Two of the most commonly known subspecies are Gand with lungs (who
              thus require ammonia respirators) and Gand without lungs who absorb the necessary compounds through consumed
              food and liquids. There are many other subspecies, and rumors of genetic manipulation abound, but no outsider
              has verified these claims. The Gand find questions about their physiology perplexing and a little embarrassing.</p>
            <p>On average, Gand stand a little over one-and-a-half meters tall, have three fingers on each hand, and have
              large compound eyes capable of sensitive night vision. Their skin color range from brown to green to purple.
              Due to their genetic diversity, many Gand possesses characteristics that vary from the norm, including heads
              of unusual shapes and sizes, additional fingers, and multiple versions of internal organs. All Gand tend to
              have a tough yet flexible exoskeleton, and their regenerative abilities are remarkable, making them a hardy
              species.

            <p>Gand society, to outsiders, appears to contain a multitude of contradictions, mostly due to the visitors’
              imperfect knowledge. For example, early academic records suggest the Gand had a monarchy. However, no such
              currently lineage exists, and the Gand don’t appear to have a word for queen or king. Whether the records detailed
              an offshoot colony, the Gand evolved away from a monarchical government, or the original academic mistakenly
              attributed hive insect characteristics to the species, only the Gand might know, and they have no interest
              in the topic.</p>
            <p>Other academics call Gand society meritocratic. While the Gand value individual achievement, they don’t believe
              it superior to communal achievement, simply different. For example, individual Gand have no first name until
              achieving something notable. However, there is no shame in only owning a surname. After all, a society requires
              the hard work and dedication of the unnamed. Some academics believe that becoming notable, and thus more individual,
              separates a Gand from the community, resulting in a philosophical crisis for that individual. Again, only non-Gand
              project any negative connotation onto this change in status. To Gand, individuality is necessary and natural,
              both a loss and a gain, and a process that is simultaneously complex and simple.</p>
            <p>Gand refer to themselves as “this Gand” up until they become full-fledged members of society. At that point,
              they refer to themselves by their surname. If Gand achieve something particularly impressive, such as becoming
              findsmen, they may introduce themselves with their first name. Only the most accomplished of Gand call themselves
              “I.” If a Gand performs a shameful act, that individual may revert to a single name or no name at all as temporary
              penance.
            </p>
            <p>The Gand undergo this process of naming due less to rigid rules than to the structure of their society, culture,
              and language. They view self-promotion the same way. For a Gand, faking a name or reputation is as odd and
              strange as a human introducing herself using the name of a famous Duros actor. While there are instances of
              Gand falsifying a name, they are rare outliers.</p>
            <p>Outsiders tend to call Gand xenophobic, but the insectoid species bears no widespread hatred or fear of non-Gand.
              Gand are, however, particularly concerned about the disruption of their culture by outsiders. Even the casual
              adoption of a loan word may cause confusion and miscommunication that ripples unpredictably throughout Gand
              society. The fact that their ammonia-based atmospheres allow them to segregate outsiders makes avoiding culture
              disruption an easy matter, however. It also helps that traveling Gand often return to their homeworld or a
              nearby Gand society to get back to their roots.</p>
            <p>Academics have various theories about contradictory reports on Gand society. Some believe the society is undergoing
              rapid changes and cultural shifts. Others believe the Gand explain themselves in vague and contradictory terms
              to prevent cultural disruption. A few academics suggest the misinformation is a deliberate cultural prank—an
              example of Gand humor.</p>

            <p>The rocky Outer Rim planet <b>Gand</b>, located in the Shadola sector of the Slice, has an atmosphere of thick
              ammonia mists that is toxic to most oxygen-breathing life forms. Gand isn’t near any major hyperspace lanes,
              and is close to the Centrality, a region so devoid of stars that starships have been known to run out of fuel
              when crossing its barren expanse. For these reasons, as well as for the species’ insular nature, Gand remains
              isolated from the rest of the galactic community.</p>
            <p>However, outsiders can visit at the various orbital stations surrounding the homeworld, built to facilitate
              trade. The Gand designed the stations for the comfort of offworlders, so they can wander about freely while
              the Gand wear breathing apparatuses. A few privileged offworlders have been given permission to set foot on
              Gand soil, but only in the alien quarters at spaceports. As the ammonia mists are usually thick and dangerous,

              Gand struggle to produce the sounds for Basic, and so they depend on translator modules or droids. The particulars
              of the Gand language means translations often sound simplistic or “childlike,” adding to the perception that
              Gand are uncomplicated and humble.</p>
            <p>Gand who travel offworld make dedicated efforts to learn other languages (mostly to avoid embarrassing misunderstandings).

              perception as any other Gand sense, or perhaps they don’t have an equivalent word for the Force.</p>
            <p>Other species with knowledge of the Force think that only Gand findsmen are Force-sensitive, and findsmen’s
              prey swear those Gand do have something more than simple talent. In addition, findsmen exhibit a specific kind
              of mysticism in hunting their prey, seeing signs and portents in everyday things: swirls in smoke, scratches
              on durasteel, or reflections on transparisteel. The findsmen are in decline, however, and accounts of their
              abilities have been fading into myth and legend, just like tales of the Jedi.</p>

            <p>Gand mysticism immediately summons the image of the findsmen. Expert trackers, the findsmen turned this profession
              into a religious pilgrimage, gaining a well-earned reputation for tracking prey, lost objects, and missing
              people.
            </p>
            <p>This mysticism, however, bears a strong resemblance to the Force. Some believe that the religious worship
              the findsmen utilize can be found in any Gand who seek out notoriety and excellence in the earning of their
              name, a process they call janwuine. The act of obtaining janwuine, of becoming a master at a task, is itself
              a mystical act.
            </p>
            <p>A Gand weaponsmith, for example, would prepare to make future masterpieces in similar ways, traveling the
              galaxy to learn the best weapon-crafting techniques and following mystic insights to unearth old technologies.
              Gand consider the travel itself a necessary tempering of body and mind before crafting a masterwork.</p>
            <p>However, most of this is conjecture on the behalf of non-Gand academics. Outsiders may call this work following
              the path of the Force. Gand would simply call this earning their name.</p>
