                  chooses to play a Gand with lungs, he starts the game with an ammonia respirator, and treats oxygen as
                  a dangerous atmosphere with Rating 8. However, he gains + 10 starting XP.</p>

    <p><b>Gands</b> are a mysterious insectoid species whose "findsmen" treat tracking quarry as a religious duty. They are
      exceptionally good at divining the location of individuals through ritualistic methods that offworlders might consider
      backward and barbaric.

            <p>Though prevalent in the fringes of the Outer Rim, Gands remain a puzzle to xenobiologists. Over a dozen distinct
              subspecies of the Gands have been reported. All are covered in a dense chitinous exoskeleton and reach a height
              at adulthood of about 1.6 meters. They have three fingers on each hand, which are as dextrous as those of other
              humanoids, allowing them to manipulate equipment designed for five-fingered individuals.</p>
            <p>Where Gands subspecies differ from one another is in their respiratory biology. Most Gands who travel the
              spacelanes do not seem to need to breathe at all. The digestion of food in their stomachs produces the ammonia
              necessary for their biochemistry. Wasteful byproducts and extraneous ammonia are expelled through their exoskeletons.
              These Gands often emanate an unpleasant methane musk. Other Gand subspecies possess actual lungs and cannot
              produce ammonia through digestion, instead requiring a special breathing apparatus.</p>
            <p>Questions about Gand biology continue to go unanswered, since the Gand refuse to permit other species to study
              them. Some xenobiologists conjecture that Gand religious rituals dictate genetic manipulation, which has produced
              many different varieties of Gands.</p>

              Off-worlders are most familiar with the religious sect known as the "findsmen." These are the Gand who leave
              their home planet on ritualistic hunts to catch prey and bring divine blessings to their people. Many other

            <p>Droids fare much better than well-trained humanoid linguists in reproducing the clicks and chirrups of the
              Gand spoken language. Without the need to intake breathable gases, most Gand lack the vocal cords to make the
              sounds of Basic and other languages. They must use droids or translation devices to converse in groups that
              do not understand their language.</p>
            <p>The grammar that Gand use reflects their place in society. Before a Gand earns his identity and is accepted
              among his peers, he refers to himself in the third person, calling himself "Gand." Once he has done a deed
              of distinction, a Gand may take his family name. Gand cannot use their first names until they have become "persons
              of greatness"—janwuine in their own tongue—and received commendations from their peers. This causes many off-worlders
              to view the Gand as a people of extreme humility.</p>
