                                <p class="card-text">The Consular focuses on the goal of achieving peace and harmony through
                                        positive discourse. Followers of this career try to avoid physical conflict whenever
                                        possible. Instead, they have faith in the Force to fuel basic compassion in all sentient
                                        beings. They believe that it is always more effective to have an intelligent discussion
                                        about a problem and then solve it through negotiations and other peaceful means than
                                        to engage in conflict to resolve it. They are opposed to needless violence but know
                                        that when confronting true evil, they must be willing to take decisive action. A
                                        Consular prides himself in knowing when to speak words of peace, and when the time
                                        for words is over.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Followers of this career are not Jedi Consular of the now-fallen Republic,
                                        but they do embrace some of the same philosophies and practices. During the time
                                        of the Galactic Civil War, Consulars are a relatively rare breed. Imperial negotiations
                                        are most commonly handled through a position of vastly superior military might. Consequently,
                                        the Empire has little use for their peaceful approaches.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">In contrast, the Rebel Alliance has a far greater need for Consulars.
                                        As the various smaller Rebel groups come into contact with one another, they need
                                        negotiators capable of building a foundation for an alliance. Consulars have helped
                                        build the foundations for the fight for freedom, bringing groups of diverse backgrounds
                                        and needs together and joining them in common cause against injustice.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Even as the Rebel Alliance becomes a well-established entity, the need
                                        for Consulars continues. Maintaining the Rebellion’s push against the Empire requires
                                        assistance from a broad range of different groups. Consulars are capable of working
                                        with planetary governments—and even large corporations—to procure the equipment necessary
                                        to maintain and grow the Rebellion. They are also instrumental in persuading worlds
                                        to risk attempts at throwing off the shackles of the Empire.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Of course, not every Consular has necessarily played a role on the galactic
                                        stage. In fact, many help settle disputes closer to home, in small villages or planetary
                                        governments. Most Consulars see helping two feuding families find peace to be as
                                        rewarding as convincing an entire world to join the fight against the Empire.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Beginning characters—particularly those who are cognizant of their Force
                                        abilities—are most likely to have learned their techniques from relatively obscure
                                        traditions. Alternatively, characters who do not recognize their abilities could
                                        be extremely competent negotiators, such as accomplished political, religious, and
                                        business leaders. Any of these individuals might unwittingly tap into their Force
                                        abilities during the course of their work. This could provide the basis for a character
                                        who denies any knowledge of Force techniques while simultaneously depending on them.</p>
