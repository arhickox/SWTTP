    <p><b>Klatooinians</b> are heavily built humanoids, roughly the height of the average human, descended from canine ancestors
      on the planet Klatooine. Renowned for their loyalty and devotion, Klatooinians have lived under contracted servitude
      to the Hutts for more than 25,000 years. First recruited to help defeat Xim the Despot, a galactic overlord vying for
      control with the Hutts, the Klatooinians signed a "temporary" pact of servitude that is still considered valid by both
      the Klatooinians and the Hutts today.</p>
    <p>Understanding the Klatooinians' fixation with time is essential in order to understand the deeper underpinnings of
      their culture. Most of their mythology revolves around all-powerful patron-beings known as the Ancients. Tenacity and
      perseverance are among their most prized cultural traits, and they particularly revere elders of any race. When the
      Hutts first approached the Klatooinians with a request for assistance against Xim, many on the planet Klatooine came
      to believe that the Hutts were the Ancients, and that signing a pact of servitude to them was tantamount to agreeing
      to serve the gods.</p>
    <p>The Hutts have dominated Klatooinian culture ever since, with the full blessings of most of the species. A Council
      of Elders determines Klatooinian affairs, but all offworld relations are in the hands of the Hutts. Klatooinian education
      is also completely under Hutt control. This has nearly eradicated all early Klatooinian culture and language. As civil
      war spreads through the Empire, however, some Klatooinians find the courage to break away from the Hutts and strike
      out on their own.</p>

            <p>Klatooinian society emphasizes loyalty and devotion over everything else while revolving around their near-worship
              of the concepts of time and age. The planet Klatooine is ruled by a Council of Elders. These members of the
              species are chosen for their age and experience, as well as how well they are able to articulate their understanding
              of Klatooinian mythology and culture in a series of ceremonial debates. The Council rules from a palace situated
              near the Fountain of the Ancients, located in the Derelkoos Desert.</p>
            <p>Klatooinian education focuses on written and spoken Huttese, Klatooinian history, and legends that feature
              Klatooinian species-wide dedication to the Hutts. When a Klatooinian reaches adulthood it is delivered into
              slavery, at which point its future occupation is decided and more practical training begins. Before eventually
              being given a position or responsibility, the Klatooinian slave is usually granted more extensive training
              by his master for specific duties.</p>

              located in the Si'klaata Cluster at the galactic northern extreme of Hutt Space.</p>
            <p>The primary feature of the planet is the Fountain of the Ancients, considered a holy site by all Klatooinians
              and the seat of secular and religious power. The Fountain is a fissure in the planet's crust that releases
              liquid wintrium into the dry atmosphere. Wintrium solidifies upon contact with the air and appears like water
              frozen in mid-flow, continually hardening with age to the point of near indestructibility. After many thousands
              of years, the Fountain of the Ancients has grown to be a wondrous sight—sprays and waves of liquid frozen in
              midair.

          <p>The Treaty of Vontor, signed prior to the final defeat of Xim the Despot, relegated the entire Klatooinian species
            to perpetual servitude to the Hutts. However, the Hutts did not take into account one element of the Klatooinian
            cultural character. Although the Klatooinians revere age and experience, they also believe that only time itself
            is eternal, and all else must eventually fade away. This view is extended to the Treaty of Vontor by the Klatooinians,
            although they do not speak freely about it before their Hutt masters. In essence, no Klatooinian believes the
            species can be subject to the treaty for eternity.</p>
          <p>With the eruption of all-out civil war against the Galactic Empire, many young Klatooinian students and slaves
            have decided that the time for the dissolution of the Treaty of Vontor has come. Meeting in secret both on their
            homeworld and off, these rebels study scraps of ancient texts missed by the purges of the Hutts. Reviving their
            language and the truth of their ancient myths and legends, they seek to restore the independence of their people.</p>
          <p>Fearing the retribution of the Hutts. these rebels tend to congregate in secret enclaves located in remote locations
            across Klatooine or offworld. The Hutts, aware of the growing unrest, have subjected the Klatooinians to harsher
            and harsher restrictions, only to find the resistance to their rule growing rather than fading. Many Klatooinians
            truly believe that the time has finally come for theV people to throw off the shackles of their masters and begin
            forging their own destiny.</p>
