            <p>Trandoshans, who call themselves the "T'doshok" in Dosh, come from a society that emphasizes strength, skill
              at hunting, resilience, and self-reliance. Clutches of four eggs are raised by the mother (the father seldom
              has any involvement); young Trandoshans can walk and possess an instinctual hunting ability almost from birth.
              By two years of age, their mother takes them on their first hunts, and by ten they are largely self-sufficient.</p>
            <p>Trandoshan society revolves around two things: the hunt, and worship of a goddess known as the Scorekeeper.
              She watches over the Trandoshan people, blessing or punishing them based on the success of their hunts. For
              each successful hunt and quarry brought to ground, the Trandoshans receive jagannath, "divine marks," that
              show a Trandoshan's status in society when tallied. As a Trandoshan gains jagannath, he also gains favor with
              the goddess. When a Trandoshan dies, he bows before the Scorekeeper and presents his jagannath quiver. That
              final tally of jagannath decides his place in the afterlife.</p>
            <p>As Trandoshan society has evolved in the galactic community, the importance of the hunt has merged with other
              societal pursuits as well. Now, a Trandoshan doctor may "hunt" for a cure against a virulent disease threatening
              his people, or a Trandoshan engineer may "hunt" for better starship designs or more potent weaponry. In fact,
              almost any action that betters the Trandoshan people can be justified as a worthy "hunt" in the eyes of Trandoshan
              culture. Of course, this leaves little room for "frivolous" pursuits such as the arts.</p>

            <p>In the eyes of the Trandoshans, their feud with the Wookiees began when the Wookiees brutally killed the members
              of a peaceful Trandoshan scouting mission on Kashyyyk. The Wookiees' savagery caused the Trandoshans to believe
              the Wookiees were non-sapient barbarians and therefore had no resource rights to the planet. For added protection
              on their next mission, the Trandoshans brought a well-armed military force. Nonetheless, in the intervening
              years since the Trandoshans' first landing, the Wookiees had managed to decipher the engineering of the Trandoshans'
              scout vessel. After months of bloody conflict during which the Trandoshans served their goddess with distinction,
              the Wookiees overpowered the Trandoshans by sheer numbers. Further peaceful colonial missions by the Trandoshans
              met the same end.</p>
            <p>The Trandoshans appealed to the Old Republic, but discovered that the Wookiees had already encountered the
              off-worlders and told their lies to the Senate. Soon it was the Wookiees who represented the Hsskassi system
              in the Senate, with no Trandoshan representatives. The Trandoshans felt isolated and had no recourse but war.
              The Republic eventually sent peacekeeping troops.</p>
            <p>Chancellor Palpatine finally listened to the desperate pleas of the Trandoshans. Dignitaries convinced him
              to give them representation for the Hsskassi system in the Imperial Senate in return for helping quash the
              Wookiee rebellion on Kashyyyk. Moreover, the Trandoshan dignitaries promised to catch and deliver Wookiee slaves
              to the Empire. With Kashyyyk occupied by the Imperial military, the Trandoshans had at last gained the upper
              hand over their neighbors.</p>
            <p>Not all Trandoshans agreed with this new approach. The Trandoshan Jedi Master Krassk M'ikosh, having tried
              for years to negotiate a peaceful settlement between the Wookiees and his own beloved people, died while protecting
              a Wookiee child against Trandoshan slavers.</p>
