    <p>Whereas the Empire generally treats its <b>droids</b> as little more than self-directed tools and disposable assets,
      the Alliance has come to value the contributions and involvement of droids in their efforts. Droids help fill personnel
      gaps across the board, especially in noncombat roles. Astrogation, engineering, medicine, and even piloting (when there
      aren't enough breathing pilots around)â€”all are tasks droids readily and loyally fulfill as part of the effort to overthrow
      the Empire</p>

            <p>Creativity is not only allowed when a player decides to build a droid PC, it is encouraged. Droids are simply
              another species choice, albeit one with a wider range of variables for the player to manipulate. Their special
              abilities directly convey their non-flesh-and-blood nature, and gear choices such as weapons and armor can
              be defined as being built into the droid's body instead of functioning as separate, stand-alone equipment.</p>
            <p>The personality of a droid is a more delicate matter. The very fact that the droid is a Player Character means
              that it is self-aware and independent-minded (unless the player wants to play a character who is completely
              subservient to the surrounding biologicals, of course).</p>
            <p>Original design and function should always remain a part of who a droid is. It may have capabilities far beyond
              its initial programming, but it still maintains predilections related to what it was created to do. Power droids
              can become fully capable engineers, yet they always pay extra attention to the power flows in their areas of
              responsibility. A protocol droid might well develop the capacity to wield arms and enter combat, but it likely
              wants to explore nonviolent options first.</p>

              to work directly with organics. They are programmed for the social and service areas, such as interpretation,
              teaching, protocol, and diplomatic assistance.</p>
            <hr>
            <p><b>Class Four (Fourth-degree)</b>: Class Fours are equipped with weaponry and designed for security, military
              training and operations, gladiatorial combat, and even assassination.</p>
            <hr>
            <p><b>Class Five (Fifth-degree)</b>: Class Fives are simple labor units for a whole host of menial jobs, from

            <p>While an individual droid PC is likely at least somewhat customized, there are quite a few standard models
              that make a good starting place to work from.</p>
            <p><b>2-1B Surgical Droid (Genetech/lndustrial Automaton)</b>: The 2-1 B Surgical Droid is a highly intelligent
              and flexible thinker; as one would expect of a droid whose decisions involve life and death. Its rather ugly
              chassis hides a remarkably complex and flexible behavioral circuitry matrix, and the droids are intelligent
              and capable in equal measure.</p>
            <hr>
            <p><b>3P0 Protocol Droids (Cybot Galactica)</b>: The 3P0 series of protocol droids are some of the most human-like
              automata ever developedâ€”perfect for their assigned tasks as ambassadors, political aids, translators, and personal
              attaches. However, their advanced SyntheTech AA-1 verbobrains can sometimes develop neuroses or other "quirks."</p>
            <hr>
            <p><b>IG Assassin Droids (Holowan Mechanicals)</b>: Culminating with the feared and deadly IG-88 model, the IC
              series is infamous as one of the most lethal assassin droids in the galaxy. IG droids rarely meet an opponent
              they cannot eliminate, and true to their humorless nature, they follow the instructions for a particular bounty
              to the letter</p>
            <hr>
            <p><b>LE-VO Law Enforcement Droids (Rseikharhl Droid Group)</b>: The success of LE-VOs in deterring crime in
              the Rseikharhl sector has led to their adoption galaxy-wide as appropriate models for police assistance and
              private security. Their programming requires them to follow Imperial codes to the letter and only use force
              when absolutely necessary. Though they are hardly ever equipped with lethal weaponry, they know how to target
              a stun weapon for maximum effect.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p><b>LOM Protocol Droid (Industrial Automaton)</b>: The LOM series was Industrial Automaton's attempt to upset
              a market dominated by Cybot Galactica. IA attempted to make a protocol droid very similar to the 3P0 units
              but with an insectoid head to appeal to niche markets. However, bad PR from at least one unit's career as a
              jewel thief caused IA to scrap the line. Some of the remaining LOM droids do have a habit of developing interesting
              and unexpected personalities</p>
            <hr>
            <p><b>R-Series Astromech Droids (Industrial Automaton)</b>: The wildly successful R-series ranges from the original
              and cumbersome Rl to the famous R2 unit and all the way to the soon-to-be-released R6. Aside from the Rl (which
              is more than two meters tall and works aboard capital ships), all of the R-series astromechs are roughly a
              meter or so tall, and designed to ride in sockets aboard snubfighters to perform astrogation calculations and
              allow hyperspace jumps. A wide variety of tools also make them decent repair droids.</p>

            <p> In the wider galaxy (aside from wild rumors about "machine planets"), most droids are mere functionaries
              within societies that completely rely upon them and expect them to obey. Within the Alliance, however, they
              have come to know a higher level of respect. Though many in the Alliance's structure still hold with the idea
              of memory wipes and programming for necessary tasks only (especially when droids are acquired from Imperial
              or questionable sources), more and more leaders and commanders have taken the long view on allowing trusted
              droids to continue to develop a sense of personal independence and purpose. On more than one occasion, this
              has proven to be a brilliant strategy, and will likely continue.</p>
            <p>As such, many droids have transcended their programming and original purpose to become more than they started
              as, and find service in the Alliance very satisfactory. Granted, those coming from outside regular channels
              face a great deal of suspicion, which is often impossible to overcome. Technicians usually scan a droid's memory
              bank and programming thoroughly to ensure there are no hidden commands betraying the Rebellion in any way.</p>

            <p>Most droids are better suited to non-combat roles, serving in support areas to better enable the forces of
              the Rebellion to fight efficiently and effectively. Many droids of a technical nature serve aboard capital
              ships, often handling the tasks of dozens of non-droid crew, making personnel shortages less devastating to
              the Alliance Navy. Astromech droids abound as more and more snubfighters, like the X-wing, are brought into
