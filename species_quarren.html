    <p>The <b>Quarren</b> are a pragmatic and traditional people native to the depths of the planet Mon Cala. Throughout
      their history, they have striven to adhere to their own customs and technologies, eschewing those of outsiders such
      as the Mon Calamari. The Quarren’s earliest encounters with the Mon Calamari were punctuated by violence. Though the
      Mon Calamari were eventually able to establish a somewhat peaceful relationship with the Quarren as the result of a
      radical social experiment, the Quarren have long memories and continue to be suspicious of their worldmates.</p>

          <div class="card-body">
            <p>The Quarren are an amphibious species with leathery skin that ranges in color from orange to orange-brown.
              Quarren with unusual skin colors, such as gray-green, purple, or pink, have been documented, but such variations
              from the norm are exceedingly rare. Though they have the ability to alter their skin color at will, they only
              do so during mating rituals and refuse to do so in view of other species. Their eyes, which are an intense
              shade of turquoise, are incredibly sensitive to light and well-suited to the depths of their homeworld’s oceans.</p>
            <p>The head of a Quarren is triangular in shape, with at least four tentacles protruding from the bottom of the
              face, framing a pair of distinct fangs. The tentacles are prehensile and are used when feeding. They are also
              used to communicate, adding subtle cues to Quarren speech that often remain unnoticed by other species. Because
              of these tentacles, Quarren are sometimes called “Squid Heads,” a term that they’ve been known to take great
              offense to.</p>
            <p>Quarren bodies are lean, muscular, and well-suited to maneuvering through Mon Cala’s deep ocean currents.
              On dry land they stand, on average, between 1.7 and 1.8 meters tall, and they are capable of diving to depths
              of more than 300 meters without any manner of support equipment. Their long fingers are tipped with suction
              cups, which many exobiologists consider a holdover from their waterborne ancestors.</p>

            <p>The Quarren are a proud species with many deeply revered traditions and customs. Practical and conservative
              to a fault, they are also considered egotistical and short-sighted given their history of violence against
              the Mon Calamari. Optimism and idealism are foreign concepts to the Quarren, who believe that individuals with
              such qualities are either naive, foolish, or both. They are made especially unhappy by drastic changes, particularly
              when they feel forced into taking a particular course of action.</p>
            <p>This general demeanor is responsible for a large number of conflicts between the Quarren and their worldmates,
              the Mon Calamari. Prior to engaging peacefully with the Mon Calamari, the Quarren resided in the depths of
              Mon Cala's oceans. As they explored areas of the sea closer to the surface, they encountered their worldmates.
              Threatened by Mon Calamari technology, which far outstripped their own, the Quarren attempted to drive them
              off violently. Unfortunately for the Quarren, such conflicts typically favored the Mon Calamari, which only
              fostered continued hatred and distrust.</p>
            <p>The Mon Calamari, wishing to pacify the Quarren, resorted to an unconventional approach. They took an entire
              generation of Quarren children from their parents, raising and educating them in Mon Calamari cities. After
              a decade of education in the fields of philosophy, mathematics, and science, the children were returned to
              their people. While the Quarren children exhibited a new respect for the Mon Calamari, their elders considered
              them to be the victims of brainwashing. As the older generation gave way to the new, and the children grew
              into adulthood, the younger attitudes prevailed. The results of the Mon Calamari experiment were made apparent
              several years later when the Quarren engaged their former enemies in diplomacy.</p>
            <p>As the Mon Calamari looked to the stars for their future, most Quarren chose to remain with their people on
              Mon Cala. They felt the Mon Calamari were foolish dreamers who would be better served by focusing on their
              own planet and their place in it. When spacefaring Mon Calamari attracted the attention of the Empire, the
              Quarren were quick to point out that they’d been right all along, blaming the Mon Calamari for their predicament.
              It is even suspected that Quarren dissidents sabotaged Mon Cala’s defensive systems, which allowed the Empire
              to take the planet with few losses.</p>
            <p>The world was soon enslaved, and violent uprisings by Quarren and Mon Calamari alike were met with brutal
              violence on a global scale. Those Quarren who hadn’t escaped to the ocean depths found themselves placed in
              work camps alongside the Mon Calamari. In such miserable conditions, the two species discovered a unifying
              cause that brought them closer than ever before: the removal of the Empire through a coordinated effort of
              passive resistance, followed by an open and violent rebellion that drove the Imperials from their world once
              and for all.</p>

              cities, built by the Mon Calamari with the aid of the Quarren, emerge from the waves. The Quarren people have
              always preferred the dark security of Mon Cala’s deep water, and most of their settlements exist in hard-to-reach
              pockets on the ocean floor. Despite this, a great many make their homes in the planet’s cities, albeit within
              their deepest levels. The Quarren continue to cling to memories of the past, but even they cannot ignore the

            <p>Though the Quarren continue to keep peace with the Mon Calamari, they still remember the conflicts of the
              past with great clarity. It is often difficult for Quarren to follow the orders of the Mon Calamari, as they
              are shamed by their apparent subservience to their enemies of old.</p>
            <p>The rare Quarren who achieve high rank in the Alliance must be certain to temper their instincts and treat
              their Mon Calamari troops with respect. The Mon Calamari also recognize this, and they often take great pains
              to keep their Quarren subordinates from feeling slighted or singled out.</p>
            <p>Such friction isn’t uncommon in a fighting force as diverse as the Rebel Alliance, but it has the potential
              to cause untold problems in the ranks if it is allowed to fester. Thankfully, Quarren who serve for any amount
              of time soon learn that their Mon Calamari allies are just as invested in the conflict as they are, and that
              the goals of the Mon Calamari Rebels aren’t all that different from their own.</p>
