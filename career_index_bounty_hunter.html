                <h1>Bounty Hunter Specializations</h1>

                <div class="card career-text-card">
                        <div class="card-body">
                                <p class="card-text">The name says it all: this is a hunter who seeks to collect bounties
                                        for his work. Bounty Hunters tend to be feared, reviled, looked down upon—and in
                                        great demand throughout the galaxy. They are expert trackers, brutal combatants,
                                        and effective investigators. They tend to prefer skulduggery, stealth, and traps
                                        over frontal assaults, but the most respected Bounty Hunters will do whatever it
                                        takes to catch their quarries and collect their fees.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Bounty Hunters generally fall within three categories: Imperial Bounty
                                        Hunters, Guild Bounty Hunters, or Independents. Imperial Bounty Hunters are essentially
                                        on permanent contract to' the Imperial Security Bureau (or a similar arm of Imperial
                                        law), and they never take assignments from corporations, smaller governments, or
                                        individuals. They are highly-trusted members of the extended law-enforcement community
                                        of the Empire, usually exmilitary personnel that prefer a less-regimented (if possibly
                                        dangerous) way to serve.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Those Bounty Hunters who join a guild enjoy many excellent benefits:
                                        room and board wherever the guild has a presence, exceptional training and access
                                        to high-end equipment as needed for specific assignments, and a steady stream of
                                        jobs given to them by the guild brokers acting on their behalf. The downside to all
                                        of this is the fact that Guild Bounty Hunters have little-to-no say in what jobs
                                        they get, and failure to accept an assignment is grounds for immediate termination
                                        of a guild contract.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The greatest freedom comes with being an Independent Bounty Hunter;
                                        it also comes with the greatest challenges and dangers. Although Independents often
                                        take Imperial contracts, which are usually the most readily available and lucrative,
                                        they enjoy knowing they are not exactly a <i>part</i> of the Empire. Not being a
                                        part of a guild also serves an Independent Bounty Hunter's sensibilities; he can
                                        pick and choose his contracts as he likes, and has only himself to credit for success
                                        or failure.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Player Characters are almost certainly going to be either Guild or Independent
                                        Hunters. However, regardless of what type of Bounty Hunter is played, the character
                                        will need to have a current and legitimate Imperial Peace-Keeping Certificate (IPKC).
                                        This is the specific license that all Bounty Hunters are required to have on file
                                        with the Empire in order to operate as professionals. Without such documentation
                                        and status, a Bounty Hunter is little more than a kidnapper and, possibly, a murderer.
                                        Any character with the Bounty Hunter career automatically gains an IPKC— unless the
                                        player would prefer his character not start with one. Although this may seem like
                                        an odd choice, it could make for a particularly compelling story or character background.</p>
