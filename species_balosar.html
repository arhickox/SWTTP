    <p>Across the galaxy, <b>Balosars</b> are regarded as untrustworthy grifters and con artists. Callow and opportunistic,
      these near-humans are scorned by respectable society. Despite perceptions across the galaxy, though, Balosars are quite
      glib and somehow manage to talk their way into (and out of) situations that are none of their business. It is this
      talent, combined with their stubborn refusal to surrender when things go badly, that allows them to survive and thrive
      in a galaxy torn apart by war and corruption.</p>

              antennapalps that push through the thick hair atop their head. Their voices are often low and gravelly, though
              not from any genetic feature. Instead, this comes from years of breathing the toxic atmosphere of their native
              planet. Balosars have the same natural lifespan as humans, though many of those who remain on their homeworld
              die prematurely from the planet’s poisoned atmosphere—or by more nefarious means when they’re on the wrong
              end of a clandestine deal.</p>

            <p>Balosars are survivors above all else. They value pragmatism, leaving morality to those who have the luxury
              of high-minded ideals. Children receive little formal education and instead are raised in the shadows of the
              massive factories that cover their home￾world. Only the resourceful and clever live to adulthood. Those who
              do must rely on the use of empty promises and double-dealing to achieve any level of success. Under the subjugation
              of the corporations that rule Balosar, few rise to anything resembling a position of power or even manage to
              live comfortably unless they are able to lie, cheat, or steal their way into employment with these amoral businesses.</p>
            <p>Few even attempt to reach for this impossible status. Instead, many look for the first opportunity to leave
              their poisoned homeworld and carve out a niche elsewhere in the galaxy. Knowing that it is almost impossible
              for a near-human to achieve success under Palpatine’s rule, most seek fortune and glory in the galaxy’s criminal
              underbelly, working for a Hutt kajidic, the Black Sun syndicate, or a similar organization. Even other criminals
              tend to distrust Balosars, which makes it difficult for them to obtain a respectable position. Instead, many
              must content themselves with being an errand runner, informant, or peddler of illegal goods.</p>
            <p>Even in these low-level positions, Balosars are quite skilled at gathering information. Some establish themselves
              as invaluable employees by quietly amassing critical information and revealing it at a key moment. Others secretly
              sell their information to corporations, competing criminal organizations, or whoever is willing to pay their
              substantial fee. In spite of Balosars’ pride and tenacity, their tendency to quietly betray their employers
              prevents them from finding positions of respect and authority, regardless of how well-informed or skilled they
              are.

            <p><b>Balosar</b> is a Core World in ruins from unchecked industry. In its most famous industrial operation,
              balo mushrooms, found only on Balosar, are refined in towering factories to produce ixetal cilona, a powerful
              narcotic used in everything from death sticks to interrogation drugs. Though technically subject to Imperial
              rule, Balosar is in fact controlled by massive corporations, among them BioTech Industries and Fergriss Pharmaceuticals.
              These corporations continually engage in industrial sabotage and espionage, using the native Balosars as pawns
              in their greedy machinations. Substantial kickbacks to corrupt officials ensure the Empire ignores these illicit
              operations. Balosars caught in the webs of corporate corruption refuse to turn to the Empire for aid, fearing
              draconian reprisals—even orbital bombardment—that would sound the death knell for their already dying world.</p>
            <p>What little land that is not covered in factories and urban sprawl is home to corporate-controlled farms,
              many of which extend far underground. Each field is under heavy security. Corporations maintain greenhouses
              with intrusion countermeasures that rival those on Coruscant. These include enforcement droids, patrol craft,
              and large squads of armed guards. The farms, especially those underground, grow the coveted balo mushrooms,
              which are harvested and then refined into ixetal cilona in the city. It is regular practice for competing corporations
              to hire teams of deniable assets to rob, sabotage, or even destroy growing fields controlled by an opposing
              company. Many Balosars are tempted to engage in these quick and dirty operations for the promise of a few fast
              credits while throwing a spanner</p>

              when outsiders speak the language, it comes off as stilted and crude. Balosars speak Basic and are as capable

            <p>Death sticks are a highly addictive and highly illegal narcotic. Distilled and refined from ixetal cilona,
              they are sold in small, easily concealed, red or yellow rods. When consumed, they produce deceptively mild
              hallucinations in the user. Unfortunately, death sticks are very addictive after even a single use and rapidly
              destroy both physical and mental health at an alarming rate.</p>
            <p>Long-term use can reduce an addict’s lifespan by nearly half, and it is rumored that death sticks can diminish
              a Force sensitive’s connection to the Force. Characters under the influence of death sticks suffer &#9632 on
              any task they attempt for the remainder of the encounter; at the GM’s discretion, they may also find their
              Force rating reduced by one for the same amount of time. The effects of long-term addiction take years or decades
              to manifest and are likely to be beyond the scope of a single campaign.</p>
