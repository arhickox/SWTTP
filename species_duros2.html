              sense). Their young hatch as larvae from eggs laid by the females, but they are raised in a recognizable family
              unit. Duros aren't particularly powerful physically, but they possess sharp minds and keen intellects. Though
              both males and females are bald, other sex characteristics make them easily distinguishable.

            <p>Most scholars believe the Duros actually invented the first hyperdrive craft; the species' contributions to
              interstellar navigation are impossible to overstate. They are inquisitive and adventurous, and they take great
              pride in their extensive travels throughout the galaxy. It is, in fact, considered polite to refer to any Duros
              by the honorific "Traveler," such is their passion for astrogation and exploration of the galaxy.</p>
            <p>With a history of enslavement by a destructive empire of great technological prowess, the Duros developed
              a profound thirst for knowledge of the very science used to enslave them. When the time came, they employed
              all they had learned not only to throw off the shackles of their oppressors, but to reach out to the stars
              and never look back. Early on, the course of Duros society was charted by a highly regarded monarchy, but as
              that once-great dynasty fell to corruption, enduring Duros pragmatism led to a corporatocracy that focused
              on management of assets and development.</p>
            <p>Duros tend to be quiet, saying little and observing their surroundings. They can usually be encouraged to
              tell stories of their families and their people. Possessing exceptional memories for such things, they have
              an oral history that is rightfully a matter of great pride. In light of the disaster that over-industrialization,
              combined with numerous devastating attacks by outside forces, brought upon their planet, there's little wonder
              why they cling tenaciously to a more glorious past.</p>
            <p>In the era of the Empire, the Duros have not fared well. Their devastated home has become an occupied territory,
              their resources managed by the Imperial bureaucracy. At first, these measures were imposed in the name of rescuing
              the population and maintaining the flow of both ore and manufactured ships to the Core Worlds. Due to the Duros
              leadership's clear intention to support the Alliance, however, the Empire has militarized its presence and
              effectively enslaved the Duros people. Many Duros have chosen to scatter to the stars rather than become servants
              of the Emperor's war machine, and the Alliance greatly values the gifts and knowledge they bring.</p>
