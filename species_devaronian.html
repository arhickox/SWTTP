    <p>Known for their history as explorers and their striking (and often intimidating) looks, <b>Devaronians</b> are a spe­cies
      familiar to many galactic travelers. Unlike most other species, Devaronian explorers actually made contact with the
      greater galaxy long before the Repub­lic officially discovered the other inhabited systems near Devaron. Members of
      this entrepreneurial species are a common sight in spaceports and other centers of trade, and they are found all across
      the Outer Rim.</p>
    <p>Devaronians carry the odd burden of resembling the mythological demons of many galactic cultures. Because of this,
      they are one of the galaxy’s most distrusted species. This created numerous misunderstandings during the early days
      of their species’ expansion, especially as they encountered galactic denizens unaware of life beyond their own world.
      Though Devaronians are no more prone to diabolical bargains than any other prominent species, their reputation still
      suffers because of their looks. Anyone who has tread the galaxy extensively (or even visited a cosmopolitan watering
      hole or two in the Outer Rim) likely knows better than to judge a Devaronian by looks alone, but newcomers are shocked
      every day when they see a demon of myth ordering a drink in a bar.</p>
    <p>Through their species’ collective space travel experience, Devaronian explorers played a role in mapping the galaxy.
      While some of this work was done under the authority of the Republic, independent explorers—often with strong economic
      motivations—discovered and classified many worlds. Some Devaronian organizations possess maps that are believed to
      be more detailed and complete than even those in the official records on Coruscant.</p>

            <p>Devaronians are a bipedal mammalian species. Their skin color ranges from red to green, and a pair of pointed
              horns dominate the male Devaronian’s head; commonly, females have dark, vestigial spots in the same location
              as the male’s horns. Devaronians’ mouths are filled with sharp pointed teeth, particularly effective at rending
              the meat that dominates their diets. Besides these identifying characteristics, Devaronians have a great many
              physiological similarities to humans—though few observers would confuse the two species.</p>
            <p>Devaronians have black, silver-based blood. This unusual trait is linked to their particularly thorough blood
              filtration and cleansing system. Members of the species possess two livers, which constantly cleanse the body
              of toxins and carcinogens. This grants them an exceptionally high resistance to poisons, also enabling them
              to consume foods that are toxic to other species.</p>
            <p>Devaronian physiological quirks cause sulfur to be a particularly effective stimulant (unlike for most other
              oxygen-breathing species, who find sulfur extremely unpleasant when inhaled). When a Devaronian breaths in
              sulfur, the substance rapidly enters the bloodstream, granting the Devaronian a burst of prodigious strength
              and speed. However, sulfur is one element that their livers cannot cleanse as effectively over the long term.
              Extended exposure to sulfur can have serious medical consequences for a Devaronian.</p>

            <p>Devaronian culture is primarily matriarchal, in no small part because Devaronian men tend not to stay in one
              place long enough to achieve leadership positions. Whether these tendencies are purely cultural or have a biological
              component remains a topic of dispute amongst both Devaronians and offworld academics. Devaronian women, by
              contrast, tend to value security and prosperity, and have traditionally been the architects of Devaronian society,
              building and maintaining its cultural institutions and physical structures alike. Thus, most Devaronians who
              become corporate and political leaders, enter law enforcement, or pursue other careers with strong long-term
              prospects are women.</p>
            <p>Male Devaronians, for their part, are more likely to be risk-takers, driven by wanderlust and the thrill of
              new experiences. While not averse to creating lasting emotional bonds, most Devaronian men stay in a single
              place for only a few years before moving on, if they remain that long. Male Devaronians who start families
              often support them while working remotely, taking on positions where they can send their earnings home while
              still satisfying their desire to explore the galaxy—thus many become starship hands, traders, or even smugglers.
              Those who remain in one location to raise a family or maintain other relationships tend to change professions
              more often than female Devaronians, and develop a wider but less expert pool of knowledge and skills as a result.</p>
            <p>Of course, many individuals and even some cultural groups on Devaron defy these gender stereotypes. No few
              Devaronian women are starfaring adventur­ ers, and Devaronian history contains many men who achieved prominence
              in a single institution or field. Still, some visitors to Devaron are initially surprised at the seemingly
              low number of male Devaronians in the upper echelons of society on Devaron, as compared to vastly the higher
              ratio overall among the species’ offworld population.</p>

            <p><b>Devaron</b> is a temperate world in the Colonies region. The planet includes dense jungles and cooler mountainous
              regions. The species has established prosperous cities in most regions of the planet, though the oldest and
              most populous are within the low mountains. Devaron’s jungles are home to a range of dangerous predators, which
              continue to thrive on the largely civilized world. Journeys to these wilds are dangerous for even accomplished
              explorers.
            </p>
            <p>Despite Devaron’s long history, the jungles of the world remain untamed. However, while some species might
              see this as a strange choice for a species with the technology to clear the local flora, Devaronians believe
              that doing so would be shortsighted and foolish. The dominant form of plant life within Devaron’s jungles is
              a particularly hardy vine, which interconnects and grows to form massive tendrils tens of meters in diameter
              that run for many kilometers.</p>
            <p>These tendrils often reach the uppermost levels of the jungle and even conceal the basic terrain far below.
              The natural passageways these create make travel through the jungle far easier than it is on worlds with similarly
              lush biospheres, and while predators are a threat to travelers far from a city or town, there are few creatures
              on Devaron that cannot be dispatched with a well-placed blaster shot. Further, the biodiversity of the jungles
              offers Devaronians numerous advantages, economic and otherwise, especially in a galaxy where many worlds have
              been reshaped into vast, planet­spanning cities. Devaron has a few industrial centers and some large cities,
              but many Devaronians live in small, tight-knit villages and survive by hunting and cultivating crops in the
              jungle. Thanks to Devaron’s long and ongoing involvement in galactic exploration and trade, however, certain
              technologies are widespread, making survival in the jungle far easier for the current generation than it was
              for their ancient ancestors, who lacked such equipment.</p>

            <p>Devaron’s jungles are expansive and largely untamed. Few Devaronians ever travel to the darkest and deepest
              portions. Since the advent of space travel, male Devaronians frequently ventured offworld to slake their wanderlust,
              ignoring the far closer wild and unexplored jungles. In spite of this, Devaronian empires have risen and fallen
              within the jungles for tens of thousands of years, and remnants of these societies can still be found by intrepid
              explorers. Over the millennia, countless enclaves were built far from the sites of modern-day cities—including
              a Jedi Temple that remained active during the Clone Wars.</p>
            <p>Many of these facilities continue to harbor valuable goods even millennia after sentients last used them.
              However, the predators and other dangers that led to their abandonment may still remain active. Finding and
              salvaging the remaining goods in these sites is an extremely profit­ able opportunity, but any venture into
              the jungle means facing lost and forgotten dangers as well.</p>
            <p>Player Characters might uncover maps or journals that identify facilities concealed by Devaron’s jungles.
              A mine might still have a vein of ore, which could be better obtained with newer technology. A pirate’s base
              of operations might have treasures that were carefully guarded by droids that remain active centuries later.
              A lost city could still hold the treasures of those who dwelt there, but the plague that killed its inhabit­
              ants might yet linger in local wildlife that carries it without displaying the symptoms.</p>
