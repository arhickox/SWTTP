    <p>The <b>Chevin</b> are solidly built and hard to overlook, being taller than humans and nearly twice as wide. They
      have large, leathery faces and long, prominent snouts. Their impervious gray skin stretches over thick, muscular limbs,
      and their sense of smell is refined enough to identify a case of colored water ina shipment of booster blue. Once a
      species of hunters, Chevin are now renowned for hunting credits, a task for which they are uniquely skilled.</p>
    <p>Trade is an important activity for Chevin, whether among themselves or on an interplanetary scale. They pride themselves
      on their business acumen, and consider wealth tantamount to prestige. Their main exports are slaves and slave-related
      technology, the only technology they have developed themselves. The Empire is the main customer for the latter. For
      this reason most Chevin consider the Empire good for business, and so accept and support Palpatine's New Order.</p>
    <p>Chevin have developed a reputation for ruthlessness among other species. They drive a hard bargain, and their opportunist
      natures mean they capitalize on those in need. By Chevin standards, if a colony is willing to pay more than foodstuffs
      are worth to avoid starvation, the merchant should charge more. If the captain of a starship needs a spare part immediately
      or risks capture by Imperials, to ask a less than extortionate price makes no business sense. Chevin etiquette demands
      honesty, not mercy.</p>
    <p>In a culture so obsessed by commerce, honesty plays a vital role. After all, honesty is an essential component of
      trust. Without trust, the trading and exchanging between Chevin villages would break down. As a result, the Chevin
      moral code requires them to be scrupulously honest, and so Chevin never fail to keep their side of a bargain. On the
      other hand, they expect the same values to be upheld by other species they deal with, and when double-crossed, they
      prove violent and unrelenting in seeking revenge.</p>

            <p>Chevin are strong and tough, with thick hides that are both insulating and insensitive. They absorb damage,
              and it takes a lot to injure a Chevin or even cause him pain. Few humanoid species could successfully tackle
              a Chevin with anything less than a blaster. Fortunately, though they are by nature aggressive, given the choice
              Chevin are more likely to negotiate than fight. They earn more credits that way.</p>
            <p>The double-lidded eyes of the Chevin allow them to see in sandstorms or blizzards. They once used their long
              snouts to track prey, and so their sense of smell is highly developed. Now they are more likely to use it to
              check the quality of goods than to followa backshin's trail.</p>

            <p>On Vinsoth, the Chevin evolved alongside the Chevs, the other sentient species on the planet. The Chevin,
              being more aggressive and hardier fighters, long ago conquered and enslaved their near-human neighbors. Chevin
              were once hunter-gatherers, but as slavers they have come to rely on the Chevs.Their slaves manufacture and
              farm for them, while the Chevin have become expert traders and delegators who like to be in charge. Chevin
              demand respect and thrive in positions of dominance, making them well suited to leadership roles. They have
              a knack for sensing the potential in other individuals and putting it to good use.</p>
            <p>A migratory species, the Chevin live in moving villages, using vehicles called "lodges" to transport their
              families and goods while their slaves walk alongside. Although Chevin dictators never leave the planet's capital
              cities, Chevin villages rarely stay in the same place for long. It is therefore is no surprise that Chevin
              are happy to leave their homeworld to trade, making their home wherever they happen to be.</p>
            <p>It is telling of Chevin society that the more aggressive of them tend to rise higher and do better, becoming
              the leaders in politics and business. However, a Chevin would counter that this tends to be true wherever he
              finds himself. Thegalaxy isa dangerous and unforgiving place, and so the Chevin must be strong and ruthless
              to survive. This grim outlook is a typical Chevin trait, and means that the majority of their relationships
              with other species are business relationships.</p>

            <p>The pursuit of credits takes Chevin all over the galaxy, and involves them in a multitude of different enterprises
              and projects. Some travel with slaves, depending on their outlook and prestige. They go to great lengths to
              realize opportunities, traveling vast distances to inhospitable and remote planets to reach desperate customers,
              or navigating war zones to smuggle illegal goods. It helps that their physiology equips them to survive and
              thrive in even the roughest environment. Chevin are practical and d o what they have to in order to make a
              profit, be it smuggle, gamble, trade, slave, or fight for credits.</p>
            <p>Chevin have an uncanny ability to find gaps in the market, and a willingness to do whatever it takes to fill
              them, legal or otherwise. As a result, they often operate outside the reach of Imperial law. There are even
              rumors of Chevin among the Rebels, though these Chevin invite the disapproval of their kin at home. The Chevin
              make strong, resilient fighters, and some take jobs as mercenaries. Notably, Jabba the Hutt employs a Chevin,
              Ephant Mon, as head of security. When encountering Chevin anywhere, travelers should remember that they are

            <p>There are two sentient species on Vinsoth, the Chevin and the Chevs, and the former keep the latter as slaves.
              The Chevin used their skills as hunters to enslave the Chevs, and it is still the threat of violence that keeps
              them subjugated. Most Chevin are content with this arrangement, considering slavery necessary and their treatment
              fair. There has occasionally been pressure from extremist Chevin to liberate the Chevs. However, this is often
              because they consider the situation detrimental to the development of the Chevin, rather than for moral reasons.</p>
            <p>Some of the Chevin who do disapprove of the slavery speak out, with little effect, while others leave Vinsoth
              behind and make their homes elsewhere. Reputedly, a few have even joined the Rebel Alliance in an effort to
              make changes not only to their homeworld, but to the whole of the Empire.</p>
