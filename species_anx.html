    <p>The reptilian <b>Anx</b> of Gravlex Med loom over most other sentient species, despite their natural hunched posture.
      Given this, together with their deep, rumbling voices and the color-changing crests atop their heads, there is no mistaking

            <p>Anx are native to a high-gravity world; their dense musculature, stooped posture, and heavy balance of their
              tails all reflect this to even a casual observer. However, the species can often reach four meters in height,
              despite these restrictions. Their great height allowed the Anx to easily harvest the bounty of their homeworld’s
              chiliox trees when they emerged from their subterranean habitat.</p>
            <p>Because the Anx evolved within the cave systems of their homeworld, their voices have a natural low-frequency
              echo that, while useful for communicating across vast distances underground, tends to make other species deeply
              uncomfortable. The Anx in turn are frequently discomfited by how other species have learned to read the color
              changes of the large crest atop their head as an indicator of their mood, a quirk of their communal lives in
              their native herd-based social structure.</p>

            <p>Anx society began as an extension of their natural herd structure, and even modern Anx tend to be fiercely
              devoted to their families and clans. Their internal clan structure is rooted in a mix of extended family bonds
              and political alliances, and can be difficult for outsiders to decipher. These complex ties are easily grasped
              by the Anx themselves, as their society developed its complexities long before encountering other species.</p>
            <p>The Anx developed space travel independently from galactic society. They have had a long and proud history
              of interstellar exploration and colonization, using both the ancient Gravlex Launchworks and more modern hyperdrive
              engines. The species is sometimes viewed as excessively curious, but this might also stem from their confidence
              that they can handle most things the galaxy is capable of throwing at them. Between their massive stature and
              strength and a curious ability to intuit the weak spots in the anatomy of other species, the Anx have historically
              dealt with every challenge they have faced with relative ease.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, recent events have finally confronted the Anx with a threat they cannot easily defeat. After
              the rise of the Empire, Imperial authorities seized the Launchworks in order to study the technology for potential
              weapons applications. The Imperials have polluted the planet with the hazardous refuse of their experiments
              and have placed garrisons without regard to the territorial claims of the Anx clans. Many Anx have begun migrating
              offworld, fearful of what the Imperials might do to their world next.</p>
            <p>The Anx’s reputation for courage and bold action is being tested as the Empire tightens its grip. Anx society
              lacks the resources to challenge the Empire on its own, especially with Imperial attention already upon its
              homeworld. It may be that the long legacy of the Anx could become fractured by an exodus from Gravlex Med in
              coming times, or even that the species’ proud traditions disappear entirely. Some Anx have turned to the Rebel
              Alliance in the hope of reversing their planet’s decline, while others look to their ancient practices of colonization
              as inspiration for a new start among the stars.</p>

              the surface, although many have moved to cities above ground, such as their capital of Ozlyn Gox.</p>
            <p>The planet’s terrain is mountainous, the wide reaches between the ranges housing vast savannahs teeming with
              chiliox trees and other vegetation. However, contamination from the Imperial occupation of the planet’s Launchworks
              has ravaged the ecological balance of the savannahs, and much of the native flora and fauna have begun to die

              Republic, Anx were known to have served in the Jedi Order; some rose to be respected Masters. Their grasp of
              anatomy made Anx Jedi capable as both healers and duelists, while their durable frames and fearless attitudes
              saw them willing to intervene in dangerous places to put these talents to good use. The prowess of Anx Jedi
              inspired great respect, verging on awe, when they took to the field in the Clone Wars. Unfortunately, those
              days have passed. Since the fall of the Jedi, Force-sensitive Anx have learned to be cautious about revealing
              their talents, especially given the extensive Imperial interest in their species’ holdings.</p>

            <p>he ancient Launchworks that dot Gravlex Med are not spaceports in the sense that most would consider the word.
              Instead, they are installations of massive, high-velocity cannons that were once calibrated to fire spaceships
              on precise trajectories toward other planets. After the Anx learned of hyperdrive technology (and so no longer
              needed the Launchworks for space travel), they adapted the Launchworks into garbage disposal facilities, firing
              the waste their society produced into the heart of their system’s sun.</p>
            <p>Imperial researchers traveled to Gravlex Med to study the cannons in the Launchworks for potential combat
              uses. The ancient technology yielded little of military value, though. Rather than admit they had come away
              empty-handed, the research teams recommended the Empire expand the role of the cannons as waste-disposal facilities.
              Soon, garbage scows and transports full of hazardous waste began arriving at the planet in huge numbers, depositing
              their refuse for processing and eventual disposal at the Launchworks. However, the facilities were not built
              to process so much cargo, or to contain the contamination such materials brought with them. The areas around
              the Launchworks have since transformed into rapidly expanding wastelands of toxic spills and deadly biological
              agents.
