                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Camaraderie</h2>
                <p>Each fighting unit is a family of sorts, and this is equally true within the ranks of the Alliance military
                        These Commanders seek to bring the troops together in a way that fosters trust, respect, and pride.
                        By fostering the bonds that develop between comrades in combat, Commanders are able to strengthen
                        morale and drive their people to fight harder and better than other, similar units. Unfortunately,
                        camaraderie can have unfortunate results—alienation from fellow units, instances of hazing and initiation
                        within the ranks, and overconfidence in the face of overwhelming odds.

                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Combat Victory</h2>
                <p>Not only is victory in battle necessary to the continued success of the Rebel Alliance, but it is also
                        a measuring stick by which Commanders are judged against their peers. Commanders must lead their
                        troops successfully for them to win, and troops' failures on the battlefield are inevitably linked
                        to their Commander’s failure to lead them.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Enemy Demoralization</h2>
                <p>Undermining enemies’ psychological ability to wage war is just as important as defeating them in battle.
                        Commanders realize this, and do their best to ensure that the Empire suffers every defeat on a psychological
                        level. By fostering a unit's notoriety, a Commanders can ensure that that its reputation precedes
                        it among the enemy, thereby weakening the enemy’s resolve before a fight even begins. Once a battle
                        is won, a Commander must ensure that the enemy knows it’s been soundly beaten, though the Commander
                        must take care not to resort to the Empire’s brand of brutality.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Intelligence</h2>
                <p>Commanders who focus on intelligence-gathering seek to take as many prisoners as possible, and they expect
                        their troops to keep an eye out for sources of information that can be used against the enemy. They
                        take great interest in interrogating captured foes, often doing the work themselves to ensure that
                        every salient detail is pinpointed and exploited. This micromanagement can be detrimental, however,
                        as it has the potential to distract Commanders from their other duties. Likewise, their methods as
                        interrogators can shape others’ perception of both their units and themselves.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Internal Security</h2>
                <p>These Commanders are fastidious about ensuring the loyalty of their troops, weeding out threats to their
                        units from within, and punishing infractions. Success in this endeavor ensures that their troops
                        are ready for anything, without any fear of betrayal or weakness. If they are too harsh or openly
                        suspicious of their own, Commanders can adversely affect the morale of their troops, causing them
                        to be overly cautious of their own actions lest they be seen as liabilities to their leader's command.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Loss Prevention</h2>
                <p>Ensuring that their troops are as safe as possible under battlefield conditions is these Commanders' primary
                        concern. They never send their troops into hopeless situations in which defeat is certain, preferring
                        instead to preserve their unit’s strength for meaningful battles if sacrifices must be made. If taken
                        too far, this ideology can result in weak commanding officers who lose ground because they aren’t
                        even willing to try. They may gain a reputation for cowardice, which harms both discipline and their
                        own chances for advancement.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Political Support</h2>
                <p>Gaining support from political entities is this Commander’s objective. Whether a politician or merely
                        a guerilla fighter who desires to gain the support of a subjugated populace, this Commander sees
                        political support as an efficient means of gaining victory on a grassroots level. More than conquering
                        hearts and minds, this Commander seeks to actively help local populations as much in their day-to-day
                        lives as in their efforts to resist their oppressors. Such Commanders expect their troops to respect
                        the indigenous peoples and attempt to keep collateral damage to a minimum.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Recruiting</h2>
                <p>Whether it’s to replace losses or merely to bolster their ranks, these Commanders seek to engage like-minded
                        individuals and convince them that their best contribution to the war effort can be made within the
                        Rebel Alliance. Such Commanders are always on the lookout for new prospects, though care must be
                        tak</p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Resource Acquisition</h2>
                <p>These Commanders know that proper equipment is also an essential component to victory, and the Alliance
                        is always in short supply when it comes to weapons, rations, and other goods. With each battle their
                        troops fight, these Commanders look for opportunities to enrich the supplies available to their troops
                        and their auxiliaries. They take time to schedule raids on sources of Imperial equipment when possible,
                        though they must be careful not to chase every carrot the Empire dangles in front of them, in order
                        to avoid falling into traps.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Space Superiority</h2>
                <p>Though planetary engagements are important to the overall war effort, space and air superiority are both
                        crucial to the success of the troops on the ground. Whether these Commanders command a capital ship,
                        a wing of fighter craft, or a ground-pounding infantry unit, they seek to ensure that the Rebel Alliance
                        controls the skies as well as the stars.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Tech Procurement</h2>
                <p>These Commanders ask for ingenuity and innovation from their troops. Even if their units aren’t gifted
                        with state-of-the-art weapons, they expect them to use what they have to the best of their ability,
                        and to make improvements where they can in order to improve their situation. These Commanders are
                        often more concerned with subordinates who are technologically or mechanically inclined, leaning
                        on them to provide an extra edge for the rest of their unit.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Support</h2>
                <p>These Commanders' biggest assets are the troops who serve in their unit. They believe that by supporting
                        their troops, they can increase the combat effectiveness of their unit and ensure that trust and
                        morale are properly maintained. These Commanders must be approachable, even by the lowliest private,
                        and they must be willing to learn what drives their troops—their thoughts, fears, desires, and goals,
                        both as individuals and as Rebels. By helping their people achieve their goals, they make their units
                        stronger and better able to meet the challenges posed by the Imperial war machine.
                </p>
