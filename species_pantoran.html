            <p>Fiercely independent believers in freedom and democracy, the Pantorans still have small cultural holdovers
              from a more feudal era. Pantorans wear yellow marks on their forehead, under their eyes, and on their cheeks
              to denote their family names and lineages. Most Pantorans have a general interest in genealogy and history,
              and enjoy spending time searching for long-lost relatives and connections to ancient heroes and historical
              figures. A few Pantorans still hold noble titles. Some also wear headgear and jewelry proudly denoting birthplaces
              and associated famous geographic regions where ancient Pantoran battles, treaties, artistic works, and the
              like occurred. However, in this current age, Pantorans have turned global politics and debate into an art form
              in the spirit of democracy.</p>
            <p>Bitter and heated arguments rage across Pantoran society regarding the fate of their homeworld. When the Republic
              fell and the Galactic Empire ascended, Pantorans became deeply uncertain about their relationship with the
              galaxy. In both their democratic Assembly and public squares, three different camps have formed regarding Pantora’s
              political future. One camp—the appeasers—considers integration with the Empire a pragmatic goal. With the Empire’s
              recognition, Pantora would gain security both militarily and economically. Another camp insists on maintaining
              the ideals of the Republic. These traditionalists, or republicans, consider the Empire a betrayer of those
              ideals, although many also believe that the Rebels cannot truly restore the Republic. A growing few believe
              that Pantora needs to strike out on its own, to found new colonies and exploit new resources. These expansionists
              believe that they need to forge treaties with the nearby slavers and spice traders, but enough Pantorans see
              that direction as abhorrent that any such bill dies on the Assembly floor.</p>

            <p>The far Outer Rim world of <b>Pantora</b>, a moon of the ice world Orto Plutonia, is located halfway between
              Suarbi and Alzoc in the Sujimis sector. Surrounded by slavers and spice traders, Pantorans consider themselves
              the last holdover of the Republic, complete with a democratic Assembly. The Assembly’s highest executive position
              is that of the Chairman. Second in leadership and head of the legislative branch is the Speaker of the Assembly,
              who keeps the Chairman’s power in check.</p>
            <p>Somewhat isolated from the rest of the galaxy, Pantora doesn’t suffer direct oppression from the Empire, but
              the loss of the Republic has meant the loss of resources and money from the Senate. Pantora has been alone
              for the past two decades, struggling against the lawlessness of its neighboring systems. As a result, is has
              slowly built up a small navy of patriots and volunteers. The Assembly fears that making the navy any larger,
              though, might attract the attention of the Empire.</p>
            <p>Individual members of the Assembly have made their own undocumented deals with other planets for resources,
              technology, information, and even mercenaries. The Assembly turns a blind eye as long as the deals don’t threaten
              the security of Pantora or its citizens. As time goes on, however, the likelihood of an incident forcing Pantora
              to exercise its sovereignty increases. Most Pantorans hope for this to occur later rather than sooner, especially
              as the Galactic Civil War rages on without a clear winner.</p>

            <p>Another vestige of Pantoran feudal culture is found in the various dialects of its language. Each dialect
              is distinct enough that communication, though possible, is difficult. For this reason, when the Pantorans originally
              joined the Galactic Senate, they adopted Basic as their official global language, and now Basic is the first
              language of most Pantoran children. The homeworld’s education continues to emphasize a Republic-inspired curriculum,
              so Pantoran and its various dialects are slowly becoming unfashionable. Nevertheless, distinct Pantoran accents
              still permeate their spoken Basic. In addition, some Pantorans encourage private language education. Most end
              up learning a practical trade language, such as Huttese.</p>

              galactic isolation for the past two decades they are open to new ideas, both good and bad. Their homeworld
              is flush with new philosophies and schools of thought: some foreign, others native, but all changing to match
              the Pantoran character. These include old, forbidden ideas about the Force. In addition, their devotion to
              Pantora’s future makes them highly motivated in unearthing Republic-era knowledge and technologies. They seek
              out ancient Jedi artifacts and temples as well as old Sith devices and bases, although their knowledge of the
              Jedi and Sith is spotty at best. Some younger Pantorans view the Republic as having a mythical quality, attributing
              to the Jedi near-impossible abilities more appropriate to wild tales told around the campfire. While this makes
              the average Pantoran open to the Force, it also makes them susceptible to the dark side.</p>

            <p>During the Clone Wars, Pantora attempted to petition the Galactic Senate to recognize its sovereignty over
              its parent planet, Orto Plutonia. However, the Jedi who investigated the matter discovered the Talz who claimed
              to have been there for generations. The Chairman of the Assembly declared war on the Talz, but died in the
              ensuing slaughter. After receiving emergency powers, Senator Riyo Chuchi negotiated a treaty between the two
              peoples.</p>
            <p>To many Pantorans, this One-Day War represents both the dangers of political power and the triumph of diplomacy
              and democracy. It also represents Pantora’s eager, naive, and potent desire to be recognized as a global power
              and participant in galactic politics. No world or people felt a greater psychic blow than the Pantorans when
              the Galactic Empire dissolved the Senate.</p>
            <p>New tensions are arising now between the Talz on Orto Plutonia and the Pantorans. Since the collapse of the
              Republic, Pantora has been cut off from the galaxy. It is desperate to secure resources, including the natural
              resources on Orto Plutonia. The Talz, however, have no interest in allowing industry on their planet. Some
              Pantorans want to reaffirm Riyo Chuchi’s treaty out of respect for the Talz and the Republic. Others want to
              educate the Talz and integrate them into Pantoran society and political debates. Still other Pantorans think
              the treaty only refers to the Talz’s geographic location and that the rest of the planet is fair game. The
              Talz themselves sense something amiss, as they have reported unauthorized starships landing on Orto Plutonia.
              Who is piloting them and for what end, however, they do not know.</p>
