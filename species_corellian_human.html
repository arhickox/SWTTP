            <p>Corellians have a reputation for being individualistic and pragmatic, with a recklessness that causes them
              to act impulsively. Often possessing a deep-seated rebellious streak, Corellians tend to view themselves as
              a breed apart from other humans in the galaxy, whom they generally consider somewhat staid and spiritless.
              This combination of enterprising individualism and confidence can easily be taken for arrogance (which in some
              cases it is) but Corellians generally prefer determined resolve and immediate action to any perceived indecision
              or vacillation. While thoughtful reflection and sagacity is considered a virtue among Corellians, it is not
              always a quality they possess.</p>
            <p>One trait seemingly shared by nearly every Corellian is a particular fondness for piloting fast ships. This
              characteristic has translated to the Corellian philosophy of shipbuilding, namely that faster is better. Nearly
              all Corellians are capable pilots by maturity, and swoop and speeder racing are popular pastimes. It is generally
              accepted wisdom that Corellians have naturally good instincts and quick reflexes, explaining their ability
              to push vehicles and starships to their limits (and survive), though evidence for this is often more anecdotal
              than scientific. In addition to their piloting skills, Corellians are renowned explorers, traders, engineers,
              and tinkerers. Corellians pioneered many of the trade routes that crisscross the galaxy, and their ships are
              nearly ubiquitous. They also have a not-wholly-undeserved reputation as smugglers and pirates.</p>
            <p>For a people often thought of as self-centered lone wolves, Corellians put a high premium on family bonds
              and filial loyalty. Honor and fidelity are universally valued among them, and a Corellian's word is his bond.
              Though it is said there is no honor among thieves, even the basest Corellian criminal possesses some sense
              of honor and a moral code that guides his actions</p>

          <p>S ince time immemorial, Corellia has maintained its unique sense of independence from the rest of the galaxy.
            Though a founding member of the Galactic Republic and the leading manufacturer of starships in the galaxy, Corellia
            has often pursued an isolationist policy. Corellia even had a special proviso under the Galactic Constitution
            known as Contemplanys Hermi, an Olys Corellisi phrase meaning "meditative solitude," which allowed it to close
            its borders and temporarily withdraw from the Senate and its duties to the Republic.</p>
          <p>For most of its history, Corellia was ruled by a monarch, but more than three centuries ago, King Berethron
            e Solo instituted a republic (that since evolved into a corporatocracy), which has since been headed by an elected
            executive known as the Diktat. The Diktat is charged with the direct administration of Corellia, as well as the
            overall governance of the whole sector, though this position and its duties can be more or less ceremonial depending
            on the individual Diktat and corporate powers managing the government. As such, the Diktat almost invariably
            holds the position of Governor-General of the Corellian Sector, making him the commander-in-chief of the Corellian
            military and director of CorSec.</p>
          <p>Under Imperial rule, the Diktat was permitted to continue to govern the Corellian Sector, but became essentially
            a client state of Empire. A Grand Moff was even appointed to the sector, placed in overall command of the Imperial
            forces in the region. The Corellian military, for all intents and purposes, is completely under Imperial control,
            and civil government follows Imperial direction as well. The current Diktat, Daclif Gallamby, is a slightly paranoid
            individual who works closely with the Empire to ensure the security of the Sector.</p>
