    <p>A mysterious species of mercenaries in the employ of the Hutts, the <b>Ganks</b> are among the most feared and bloodthirsty
      killers in Hutt Space. Clad from head to toe in high-tech battle armor, these faceless thugs and enforcers are rarely
      seen in the flesh by non-Ganks. The Ganks act as bounty hunters, assassins, and bodyguards for Hutts and others willing
      to pay the credits for their services and to condone their methods. They established a reputation for unparalleled
      brutality several thousand years ago during the infamous Gank Massacres, when they wiped out the whole Porporite species
      to protect Neimoidian rylltrading interests. Since then, the Ganks have solidified their position as some of the most
      dangerous guns for hire in the galactic underworld.</p>

            <p>Beneath their armor and cybernetics, Ganks are powerfully built, carnivorous bipeds with fur ranging in color
              from golden yellow to a mix of dark brown to red. Their snarling visages and beady eyes give them a dangerous,
              predatory appearance. Aggressive and belligerent, Ganks are known to have short tempers and few scruples, though
              they are strongly protective of their own kind. Cybernetics are such an important element of Gank society that
              they are virtually a part of their physiology, with every Gank having at least a few different implants or
              prosthetics.

            <p>Militaristic and warlike, Gank society is highly regimented and organized into familial packs, sometimes not
              so inappropriately referred to as murders. While not readily apparent to outsiders, Ganks conform to a strict
              hierarchy among themselves, with alphas—often the most experienced, veteran warriors—directing packs of their
              fellows. Ganks rarely operate independently, instead preferring to coordinate with other Ganks in small groups.
              Ganks are masters of ambush and squad tactics, functioning with an efficiency and lethality rarely seen outside
              of elite units. When forced to work with other, less disciplined species, Ganks frequently become frustrated
              by their disordered approach to combat.</p>
            <p>Ganks often take trophies from their foes, a habit that has garnered them the reputation of being thieves
              as well as killers. Certainly, many Ganks are prone to looting their victims’ bodies, to claim tokens that
              show the quality and number of foes they have slain. Even amongst Ganks who do not lead a life of violent crime,
              trophy-taking is often a culturally important practice.</p>

              are known to enlist small armies of Ganks when in need of professional mercenaries, in addition to engaging
              smaller groups for special contracts. While most Ganks stick closely to their packs, an individual occasionally
              goes rogue, becoming a lone hunter. This most often occurs when the sole survivor of a pack refuses to join
              another pack. These solitary Ganks often become obsessed with avenging the deaths of their pack members, spending
              years, if necessary, to track and hunt those responsible.</p>

            <p>Few species in the galaxy modify themselves with cybernetics as readily as the Ganks. It is completely unknown
              for an adult Gank to have eschewed all implants; Ganks commonly have several. Like so much about the Ganks,
              the reason for their obsession with altering their bodies with technology is a mystery, but it undoubtedly
              aids them in their mercenary professions.</p>
            <p>Among the Ganks, more cybernetics means greater prestige, and highly successful veterans are often more machine
              and wire than flesh and bone. Particularly well-augmented Ganks are dangerous foes, as their strength, speed,
              and reflexes have been artificially boosted to vastly superhuman levels. Such is their obsession with cybernetic
              technology that Ganks will accept contracts offering payment in high-tech implants and artificial limbs in
              lieu of gold or credits. This reliance on technology does have one particularly notable drawback—Ganks are
              unusually susceptible to ionization weaponry, which can effectively shut down the cybernetic portions of their
              bodies. Because of this, Ganks rarely utilize ionization blasters and grenades, and they often find being shot
              at by such weapons more disconcerting than blaster fire.</p>
