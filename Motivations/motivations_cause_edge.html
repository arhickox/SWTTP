                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="motivationHeader">The Weak/Charity</h2>
                <p>The character fights for the underdog, disliking bullies and totalitarianism. He'll put the interests of
                        those in need before his own and may donate time or money to aid the less fortunate.                        
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="motivationHeader">Non-Human Rights</h2>

                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="motivationHeader">Local Politics</h2>

                <hr>
                <h2 class="motivationHeader">Overthrow the Empire</h2>
                <p>The character despises the Empire and everything that it stands for. He may or may not be an
                        active member of the Rebellion, but he supports its goals and gives aid and comfort to those against Imperial tyranny.                        
                </p>
                <hr>

                <p>The character supports the idea of black markets, mercenaries, and other groups that fall outside of the law.
                        The character need not be a criminal himself, but may give aid to other criminals, especially if they are family members,
                        childhood friends, or if corruption is deeply imbedded in the character's originating culture.                        
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="motivationHeader">Emancipation</h2>
                <p>The character sees slavery and indentured servitude as an abomination that must be undone. He'll go out
                        of his way to aid or attempt to free anyone kept in slavery.                        
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="motivationHeader">Droid Rights</h2>
                <p>The character believes that droids should be accepted as full members of galactic society, not merely tools
                        or servants.                        
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="motivationHeader">Capitalism</h2>
                <p>The character is an unabashed capitalist and fights for the rights of merchants, trading organizations, and
                        business, sometimes running counter to the wishes of both the Empire and some criminal groups.                        
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="motivationHeader">Support the Empire</h2>
                <p>The character actually supports the goals and methods of the Empire and does his best to advance
                        its cause. He'll defend the Empire in conversation and may actively lake up arms in its defense.
                </p>
