    <p>The <b>Arcona</b> are slim-framed reptilian humanoids with clawed hands and feet. They have compound eyes, which are
      large, green, and luminous. Their hairless, scaleless skin has a wood-like texture, and green, brown, or near-black
      in color. The Arconan head-shape is distinctive, akin to an inverted triangle, and tapers into the neck, giving them
      a snakelike appearance.</p>
    <p>The Arcona rely on ammonia supplements while away from their homeworld of Cona, they have poor eyesight, and their
      claws developed for digging rather than combat. However, they are hardier than they appear. Cona is a dangerous world,
      so the Arcona are used to surviving against the odds. Their vigilance and adaptability compensate for any physical
      weakness. They are strong-willed, effective team players, and always alert for danger.</p>
    <p>Family is of the utmost importance to the Arcona, and they have a strong sense of community. They often travel in
      groups, and their wanderlust takes these groups all over the galaxy. A peaceful and composed species, the Arcona are
      welcome residents on many worlds. Their powers of observation combined with their natural community spirit facilitate
      social interactions with other species.</p>

            <p>The Arcona come from the hot, dry planet of Cona, where the blistering temperatures stretch from pole to pole
              and remain unchanged throughout the year. While they do survive in cooler climates, they show a preference
              for a temperature similar to that of their homeworld.</p>
            <p>The protuberance between an Arcona's eyes is an incredibly sensitive infrared sensory organ, able to detect
              minute changes in the heat signatures of other beings. The Arcona smell via their tongues, which is why they
              often expose this slender appendage to the air in a flicking gesture that some other species might find annoying
              or even insulting. Working in concert, these senses are exact enough to discern moods and emotions in other
              species.
            </p>
            <p>The atmosphere on Cona contains high concentrations of ammonia vapor. Ammonia produces enzymes in the Arconan
              body that are necessary for their survival. As a result, the Arcona are dependent upon the presence of ammonia,
              and when traveling offworld must take ammonia supplements. These supplements must be ingested in roughly the
              same quantities as a human may need vitamin supplements, and an Arconan can survive for long periods without
              them (though this can have long term health effects).</p>

            <p>The Arcona have a sense of community so strong that they think of themselves in the collective sense. They
              consider raising a family to be both a duty and a privilege. The Arcona expect each member of society to put
              the good of his community before his own, and in most cases he does so. On their homeworld, the Arcona live
              in family-orientated nests, clustered around a Grand Nest where the Nest Leader oversees communal decisions.
              In families, the males are the primary caregivers, since the females of the species are, by Arconan standards,
              too flighty and unreliable.</p>
            <p>Any Arcona who travels alone, for whatever reason, faces a period of adjustment as he adapts to life away
              from his hive-like community. Fortunately, the Arcona are ready and able to adapt to survive, as they have
              proven time and again.</p>

            <p>The Arconan homeworld of <b>Cona</b> lies within the Inner Rim. As it orbits a blue star, Teke Ro, Cona is
              as hot and dry as any desert planet. It is abundant in vegetation that leaches oxygen and ammonia from the
              surrounding environment, breaking it down to create water. This phenomenon is essential to the survival of
              the Arcona. The atmosphere of Cona consists of nitrogen, hydrogen, and high levels of ammonia. Most species
              require a breathing aid to visit the surface, and even then the stink of ammonia is prevalent.</p>
            <p>Cona is also rich in minerals and metals, which has been a mixed blessing for its inhabitants. These resources
              attracted prospectors and traders who originally exchanged water for mining rights, but then discovered the
              Arconan susceptibility to sodium chloride addiction. This compound acts as a hallucinogen to the Arcona, and
              addiction is ultimately fatal. Unfortunately, traders found it easier and cheaper to transport than water,
              so they imported it, putting the whole of Arconan society at risk. Swift intervention by the Republic and the
              Arconan government became necessary to prevent a complete breakdown of society.</p>

              resonance to their speech. They also struggle sometimes with personal pronouns, using "we" rather than "I."

          <p>In general, Arcona count restraint among their virtues, but sodium chloride brings out the worst in them. Often
            referred to simply as "salt," this compound is the one weakness of an otherwise strong-willed species. The biology
            of the Arcona predisposes them to crave it. Salt consumption causes vibrant hallucinations as well as irreparable
            damage to the addict's body, and is ultimately fatal.</p>
          <p>The Arconan weakness for salt is common knowledge. The golden eyes and unruly behavior of addicts makes them
            easy to identify. Their addiction makes them easy to manipulate, and ruthless crime lords employ addicts as expendable
            underlings. For an Arcona, salt is more potent than any spice, and an addict requires up to 25 grams daily to
            avoid withdrawal. Since salt is common throughout much of the galaxy, trading in salt is only lucrative for smugglers
            willing to deal illegally on Cona.This is a risky business, as salt traders caught on Cona lose more than just
            their cargo. Arcona who are not already addicts often react vehemently if offered salt, as this hated substance
            has caused so much trouble on their homeworld.</p>
          <p>Salt only affects an Arcona if the salt is relatively pure, so an Arcona can consume salted foods by mistake
            and not risk any ill effects. If he consumes at least two to three grams of pure salt, he is disoriented for
            the remainder of the current encounter, and the following encounter. He must also make a <span style="color:purple; font-weight: bold">Hard
              (&#9830;&#9830;&#9830;)</span> Discipline check if he fails, he gains 2 Addiction Obligation, if he did not
            already have an Addiction Obligation. An addicted Arcona's eyes change to a reflective, golden hue. If the Arcona
            loses his Addiction Obligation, his eyes return to their natural green.</p>
