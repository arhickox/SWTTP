            <p> Covered in short, sleek brown or black fur, Selonians are carnivorous, mammalian bipeds with long, slender
              bodies and elongated heads that bristle with whiskers. Adult females average about two meters tall, making
              them significantly taller than most humans, with slightly longer arms and legs. Males of the species tend to
              be smaller and weaker than the females. Selonians have strong tails about a half meter long that they use to
              counterbalance themselves when walking upright. Though generally bipedal, Selonians can move comfortably on
              four limbs, and their retractable claws can be used for digging and burrowing, climbing, or defense. Most Selonians
              are sterile females, with only one fertile female per den, and relatively few males.</p>

            <p> Selonian society is governed by a rigid caste system, which is itself a product of their biology. Though
              a technologically advanced society, there is no central authority on Selonia. Their culture is organized around
              dens, which are composed of a single fertile female known as the Queen, a few males, and large number of sterile
              females. The dens are further divided into septs, the offspring of individual males. The females of the septs
              tend to serve specific functions within the den based on their genetic lineage, as determined by the Queen.
              Males in Selonian society have virtually no purpose beyond breeding and are generally dismissed as essentially
              useless for anything but procreation with the Queen.</p>
            <p>Pragmatic, industrious, and sober, Selonians put the necessities and security of their den and their race
              in general above all else. Individual needs and desires are almost always subsumed to those of the den. Since
              the actions of an individual can affect the whole den, Selonians put a high value on honesty and fidelity.
              Duplicity among the members of a den is taboo in the extreme; lying is a crime on a par with murder. While
              Selonians are aware that most alien species are not as scrupulously honest in their dealings, they have difficulty
              comprehending deception and they are virtually incapable of outright deceit.</p>
            <p>Some Selonians are trained to deal with outsiders, being schooled in language, culture, and expressions intended
              to put humans and other aliens at ease. To those unfamiliar with Selonian ways, they may appear outgoing and
              friendly, though most have no interests outside those of their den. Occasionally, a Selonian thus trained may
              become enamored of alien cultures and decide to travel beyond the Corellian System. These individuals are called
              Dravas ("Wanderers" in the Selonian tongue) and are generally viewed by most Selonians with a mixture of pity
              and disgust. Yet even these Wanderers put their den and race above all else, and most eventually return home
              to Selonia.</p>

          <p>Treated as little better than prized breeding stock, male Selonians do not have many rights in Selonian society.
            Smaller and far less numerous than their female counterparts, they are generally considered inferior by the females
            of the species. Kept within their dens as virtual prisoners and expected to perform no other duties besides procreation
            with the Queen, male Selonians are rarely seen by outsiders.</p>
          <p>In spite of this, Selonian females are often identified by their sept. This has nothing to do with paternal
            pride or affection, however, but instead identifies hereditary traits passed down through the male line. Though
            genetically predisposed to accept their status within Selonian society, some males do rebel at their life of
            forced indolence and servitude, albeit in a modest manner that doesn't endanger the welfare of the den, such
            as sneaking out of the den for several hours or petitioning the Queen for some sort of responsibility.</p>
          <p>Female Selonians have difficulty understanding how males can be so fully integrated into human and other alien
            cultures, and they tend to view males in positions of authority with some degree of hesitation, if not outright
            suspicion. As such, Selonians are generally more favorably inclined towards matriarchal societies, such as the
            Drall.</p>
