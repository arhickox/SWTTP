    <p>Best known as a kindly and soft-spoken species, <b>Kel Dors</b> are most easily identified by the protective eyewear and

            <p>Near-hairless humanoid mammals, Kel Dors average 1.7 meters in height. Their respiratory systems are well
              adapted to Dorin’s unusual atmosphere of helium and unique gas compounds, so that they must make use of filtration
              masks in order to survive in other environments. This, combined with innate toughness, does allow them to survive
              hard vacuum for a short time, an extraordinarily useful ability.</p>
            <p>Similarly, they wear protective and enhancing goggles because their black eyes are sensitized to the dim light
              and unusual atmospheric conditions of Dorin. A highly developed extrasensory organ is located at the back of
              the Kel Dor skull, tightly linked to the brain. Kel Dor skin tone ranges from a pale orange to a dark red.</p>

            <p>Kel Dors are tightly linked into their extended families. Several generations of a family often live together
              by choice. This offers an opportunity to share responsibility for the extended family’s younglings and ease
              in consulting the family’s elders for advice. Often, entire families share a common career, which can lead
              to family-owned businesses that span successive generations.</p>
            <p>Technological advancement drives Kel Dor society strongly. Due to its own specialized needs, the species has
              become particularly adept at designing environmental systems. These include individual and large- scale systems
              suited to a wide variety of environments.</p>
            <p>Justice is certain and swift on Dorin. Security workers are quick to offer assistance to those in need, but
              they are also unwilling to wait long to see justice delivered. Instead, they interpret legal and moral issues
              in stark black-and-white terms, ignoring any potentially mitigating factors.</p>

            <p>The Kel Dors have had a strong connection to the Force that predates their association with the greater galaxy.
              For millennia, Sages of the obscure Baran Do tradition served as advisors to Kel Dor leaders. Depending on
              sensory deprivation to offer a greater insight into the Force, these practitioners refined skills that were
              later practiced by the most talented of Jedi. Whereas most Kel Dors have black eyes, those with the strongest
              connections to the Force frequently have silvery eyes, a fact that can be exceptionally dangerous for practitioners.
              Since the rise of the Empire, more than a few Kel Dor Force-sensitives have been identified by their distinctive
              eyes and killed by Imperial agents.</p>

            <p>Thousands of years before Dorin became aware of the Galactic Republic, the Kel Dor had already discovered
              the power of the Force and crafted their own traditions. A group of skilled and powerful mystics known as the
              Baran Do Sages studied the Force so that they could expand their abilities to predict danger for their people.
              The Sages delved deeply into the ability to foresee events, whether those events were in the past, in the future,
              or in faraway lands. Soon, they not only became an invaluable resource for criminal investigations, but also
              served as advisors to Dorin’s leadership. Their predictive abilities helped Dorin avoid natural disasters,
              famines, diplomatic incidents, and even outright wars.</p>
            <p>With the coming of the Republic and the Jedi Order, the Baran Do’s influence dwindled. Many Force sensitives
              joined the Jedi, and thus the ranks of the Sages quickly shrank. By the time of the Clone Wars, most Kel Dor
              had forgotten the Baran Do ever existed, and the few who know about them are unsure whether any Sages have
              passed on their traditions to the modern age. This may be a boon in disguise, however. As the Empire hunts
              down Force-sensitives across the galaxy, obscurity could prove the best defense.</p>
