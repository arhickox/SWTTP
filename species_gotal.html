            <p>Gotals are tall, burly humanoids that evolved as hunter-gatherer tribes on the harsh plains of Antar 4. A
              coarse, dense layer of fur covers these rugged bipeds in shades ranging from sandy brown to smoky gray. Tiny
              vestigial nostrils, a pair of beady red eyes, and a wide grimace adorn their gristly, elongated faces. From
              their heavily knobbed brow sprouts a pair of conical bovid horns packed with millions of nerve clusters sensitive
              to electromagnetic fields, radio waves, and numerous other forms of energy. Gotals use their energy-detecting
              horns as their primary sensory organs, since the peculiar conditions of their moon make it difficult to function
              by sight alone.</p>
            <p>Gotals use their energy sensitivity to detect the presence, mood, and general wellbeing of nearby living creatures
              through their electromagnetic aura. On their home, Gotals employ this sensitivity to stalk herds of quivry
              and other prey-beasts with ease. Their ability to discern the emotions of others through brain wave patterns
              and other electromagnetic emanations forms the basis of their entire way of life.</p>

            <p>Antar 4’s harsh, unpredictable environment (caused by its complex orbital cycle within a binary star system)
              forced the Gotals’ primitive ancestors into a nomadic lifestyle. Limited success with planting crops meant
              the hunter-gatherers of early Gotal civilization had to follow herd beasts during their migration in order
              to survive. Gotal hunters used their remarkable ability to detect herds and could discern the type, number,
              and well-being of animals with astonishing accuracy. Although Gotal settlers have since established several
              cities around their world, some Gotals reject the settlers’ lifestyle and honor their ancestral traditions
              by roaming the Antarian plains. These rugged folk roam the highlands and valleys and seldom encounter settlement
              dwellers in cities like the sprawling Baal Commune.</p>
            <p>The Gotal’s ability to decipher the emotional state of others using their energy-sensitive horns played a
              central role in shaping their society. Their proficiency at detecting anger and discomfort produced a natural
              aversion to conflict; therefore, Gotals live free of any established government and maintain a peaceful anarchy.
              Awareness of the emotions of everyone around them makes courting rituals unnecessary, and Gotals often fall
              in love at first sight, remaining monogamous for life. Gotals are typically polite and discreet in their social
              interactions, avoiding expressing negative opinions to keep from upsetting others. There are exceptions, however,
              and some Gotals use their abilities to take advantage of others, often leaving their world to pursue lives
              of crime.</p>
            <p>Gotal children are abrasive and temperamental. From birth, Gotals endure bombardment of every conceivable
              form of energy emission, unable to filter the incoming stimuli. The sensory overload leaves them helpless,
              sometimes-causing catatonia or delirium. After infancy, Gotals start learning to cope with their ability, but
              they still struggle with bouts of instability until they reach maturity around twelve years of age.</p>
            <p>Although Gotals struggle with the electromagnetic interference given off by electronic devices, they have
              adapted and achieved space travel capabilities using technology employing emission-free chemical reactions.
              Gotals used this technology to explore the other moons and planets of their solar system long before encountering
              other species, and they even established mining outposts on Antar 5 to advance their civilization. Gotals have
              had millennia to adapt to the overwhelming energy fields wrought by other species that lack their unique abilities,
              but they continue to struggle with droid technology. Power sources used in most modern droids emit an energy
              pattern that causes Gotals particular discomfort, which has created an anti-droid sentiment within Gotal society.</p>

            <p><b>Antar 4</b> is one of six moons orbiting a gas giant in the binary star system known as the Antar system.
              The complex orbital pattern of moons, planet, and suns causes erratic weather patterns and a constantly changing
              diurnal cycle. Antar 4 lies along the Nanth’ri Trade Route in the Inner Rim. Antar 4’s land mass consists primarily
              of breezy grass plains and rocky steppes, but over sixty percent of the moon’s surface is covered in oceans,
              rivers, and streams. Despite the cool climate, Antar 4 lacks polar ice caps due to a bizarre rotational pattern
              caused by its steep axis along the Antar system’s orbital plane. This abnormal angle causes extreme tidal shifts
              that wrack the moon with harsh weather conditions as its seasons change.</p>
            <p>Frequent eclipses caused by the Antar gas giant and its other moons subject Antar 4 to a highly variable diurnal
              cycle. At times, Antar’s twin stars, along with the reflectivity of the gas giant’s atmosphere, bathes the
              entire moon in sunlight that is so bright that it would scorch the optic nerves of most species. Other times,
              the planet moves between its double stars and this moon, plunging Antar 4 into total darkness. Between these
              two extremes, the Antarian moons provide varying radiance and wavelengths of illumination for the Gotal homeworld
              after nightfall. This wild orbital behavior makes it difficult for anything other than hearty, fast-growing
              plant life to take root.</p>

            <p> Antarian primarily relies upon the reading of brain waves and electromagnetic auras to decipher emotions
              and basic concepts, and supplements this with speech used to convey abstract or complex ideas. To other species,
              the vocalization of Antarian sounds like a gurgled monotone, but to Gotals it has breadth and inflection thanks
              to the ever-shifting modulation created by the moods and thoughts of those around them. Due to their ability
              to detect these emotions with their horns, the Gotal language has no words to express concepts like happiness
              or sadness. The extra sense Gotals use to communicate makes it impossible for other living beings to speak
              Antarian fluently.</p>
            <p>Gotals speak Basic to interact with other species, but using vocalized speech to express emotion is a concept
              too foreign for most Gotals to grasp. Therefore, when Gotals use Basic, they speak in neutral terms devoid
              of any emotion or emphasis. This dull monotone often brings the sincerity of Gotals into question. Superstition
              that Gotals can read minds also leaves non-Gotals unsettled, widening the rift between species.</p>

          <p>For centuries, the Antarian Rangers served as a paramilitary force tasked with assisting the Jedi Order. Rangers
            were non-Force sensitive beings who performed duties ranging from exploration to resupply, also acting as a provisional
            fighting force when diplomacy failed. The Antarian Rangers’ ranks consisted of species from all over the galaxy,
            but the organization originated on the Gotal home of Antar 4.</p>
          <p>A Gotal named Kaskutal and Jedi Master Marus Timpel founded the Antarian Rangers 620 years before the Battle
            of Yavin. Kaskutal possessed limited talent with the Force, but the Jedi Order rejected him for training. Undeterred
            from helping the Order, Kaskutal used his connections to establish a much-needed logistics chain for the Jedi,
            raising funds to provide supplies and transports. This initiative grew to a galaxyspanning organization comprised
            of thousands of beings filling essential support positions for the ever-vigilant Jedi.</p>
          <p>The prolonged and bloody conflict of the Clone Wars thinned the Rangers’ ranks alongside the Jedi they served.
            After the Declaration of the New Order, the Empire declared the Antarian Rangers co-conspirators with the Jedi
            Order and hunted them to near-extinction. Any survivors slipped into the shadows to escape extermination.
