                                        <p>When action is needed, there is no hesitation despite the dangers. The character
                                                puts aside any fears before acting, whether navigating a ship through hazardous
                                                routes or engaging in combat against formidable foes.

                                        <p>While bravery is admirable, refusing to properly analyze a situation before acting
                                                is not. The character often leaps to act when more forethought would lead
                                                to other, more prudent decisions.

                                        <p>The character is open to love and can cherish the happiness of others. An open
                                                heart greatly aids the PC when interacting with others, and can lead to strong
                                                emotional bonds.

                                                reciprocated. The character becomes insecure and resentful, lashing out at
                                                any perceived rivals.

                                        <p>The character gives care and attention to every decision, judging all aspects
                                                of a situation before undertaking any action. By thinking ahead, the PC avoids
                                                many poor outcomes.

                                        <p>Excessive caution can easily become lost to fear. The PC becomes consumed with
                                                the potential dangerous outcomes of decisions and actively seeks to avoid
                                                or even actively flee conflict of any kind.

                                        <p>Life experiences are to be eagerly embraced. The character is always open to exploring
                                                new areas, meeting new people, and attempting new tasks, lest the PC miss
                                                out on something.
                                        </p>

                                                or master any one item. The character is easily diverted whenever a new attraction
                                                appears, often leaving tasks incomplete or threats unresolved.

                                                even when they are guarding their true feelings. Knowing how their actions
                                                affect others, the character is careful to treat others with kindness and
                                                dignity.

                                                Many years have likely been spent in training, study, and meditation; few
                                                can say they are the PC’s equal.

                                                and scorn. None are worthy of the PC’s company; they seem to exist only stand

                                        <p>Self-reliance is the watchword, for depending on others is a sign of weakness.
                                                Often refusing aid, the character never counts on others when an action can
                                                be performed personally.

                                                in the character. None are as able as the PC, and this overconfidence can
                                                easily lead to catastrophe.

                                                The PC is concerned only with laws or a personal code, no matter the situation
