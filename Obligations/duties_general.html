                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Combat Victory</h2>
                <p>The Player Character is driven to show that the Alliance can hold its own against Imperial forces in any
                        troop vs. troop engagement. He wants to engage the Empire's military—thei r best, whenever possible—and
                        provide more victories for the Alliance to tout to the galaxy as proof it can ultimately win the
                        war. This means daring raids, excellent tactics, and acquiring the best firepower possible.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Counter-Intelligence</h2>
                <p>The PC knows that the survival of the Alliance depends upon its ability to hide from the Empire and avoid
                        complete destruction at the hands of its overwhelming military superiority. To this end. he wants
                        to hunt down and eliminate enemy agents and threats, feed false information to Imperial intelligence
                        networks, and cover the movements of all Alliance assets from observation and reporting.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Intelligence</h2>
                <p>The PC knows that every victory hinges on knowing as much about the Empire's military might and other
                        assets as possible. He is driven to gather any and all potentially useful data, wishing to locate
                        vital and vulnerable targets for Rebellion forces to strike at. He not only wants to know what the
                        Imperial military factions are up to. but also the state of technological research, economic policies,
                        and other aspects of Imperial strength.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Internal Security</h2>
                <p>The most dangerous threat to the Alliance comes from within its own ranks. Any Rebel soldier, operative,
                        or ally could be an insidious threat waiting to take an action at a critical moment to bring entire
                        operations crashing down, costing lives and assets. Knowing that vigilance against these threats
                        is the truest form of devotion to the cause of the Alliance, the PC watches for any and all signs
                        of betrayal.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Personnel</h2>
                <p>More than machines, credits, or information, the people of the Alliance are the most important and vital
                        assets there are, and the Player Character knows this. He is devoted to seeing to their safety, well-being,
                        and capacity for success. No one should ever be left behind: the most successful missions might not
                        achieve every goal, but they are successful nonetheless when no one dies.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Political Support</h2>
                <p>Every blaster, starhghter, and thermal detonator in the galaxy is useless without the political will to
                        truly challenge and overthrow Palpatine and his New Order The Player Character understands this all
                        too well and is determined to see to it that as many factions, systems, and sectors as possible come
                        to the side—and the aid—of the Alliance against the Empire.</p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Recruiting</h2>
                <p>Every engagement with the Empire is a war of attrition, and that is a war the Rebellion simply cannot
                        win. Nonetheless, more people must be found to serve, and they are needed in every capacity. Not
                        only does the Alliance military need more soldiers and pilots, it needs more technicians, engineers,
                        mechanics, scientists, doctors, slicers, and just about every other kind of worker. This Player Character
                        understands the risks of recruitment, as well as the needs, and is constantly on the lookout for
                        allies who are both talented and trustworthy.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Resource Acquisition</h2>
                <p>There are never enough supplies to fully suppor t those fighting against the juggernaut that is the Empire,
                        and this PC knows it very well. He is determined to seek out new sources of raw materials, food,
                        clothing, weapons, armor, and equipment of all kinds. One spare crate of medpacs can save quite a
                        few lives, and a handful of comlinks can mean the difference between success and failure on a mission.
                        He will trade, beg. borrow, and steal anything for the cause.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Sabotage</h2>
                <p>The largest and most powerful military force in the history of the galaxy is also the most vulnerable
                        to acts of destruction and asset denial. The character is focused on disrupting Imperial operations
                        in any way possible, whether it's the manufacture of weapons, troop movements, supply shipments,
                        banking systems, or any other key operation, in order to make the Empire act more slowly and less
                        capably. Truly showy acts of destruction also work to erode a population's will to suppor t the Empire,
                        or so the PC often believes (though the Alliance expressly forbids actual acts of terrorism).
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Space Superiority</h2>
                <p>As the Combat Victory-driven PC feels about troop conflicts, so this Player Character feels about ship-to-ship
                        combat and naval engagements. To him, the war will ultimately be decided in the stars, and what the
                        Alliance lacks in sheer numbers, it more than makes up for in the quality and tenacity of its pilots.
                        Every single space battle is an opportunit y to show the rest of the galaxy that the Alliance not
                        only can win the war, but is destined to do so
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Tech Procurement</h2>
                <p>There is no more prolific or productive time for technological developments than during a war, and this
                        one is no exception. This Player Character sees the true opportunit y for Alliance victory in the
                        hands of scientists, engineers, and technicians. Not only can they get the most performance from
                        existing machines and resources, but they can design and develop new ships, weapons, medical techniques,
                        and equipment that can provide the vital edge necessary to survive against the Empire's might. The
                        way this PC sees it, stealing the best developments of the Empire is a crucial way to even the odds.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Support</h2>
                <p>Individually, the lone agents of the Alliance don't stand a chance against the combined might of the Galactic
                        Empire. Only by working together can they hope to achieve a victory in this civil war. This PC is
                        devoted to helping fellow Rebels fulfill their Duties by providing whatever assistance they need.
                        Although he might not get the same amount of reward or recognition as the people he is helping, the
                        PC has many more opportunities than his fellows to fulfill his Duty to the Rebellion.
                </p>
