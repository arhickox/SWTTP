                                                all life, from the lowly worm to the most noble of philosophers. All beings

                                        <p>The galaxy is a big place, and with so many people suffering, it can overwhelm
                                                a Mystic. How can a single person help anyone else when there is so much
                                                unhappiness? The Mystic lets sorrow paralyze, or worse, affect their use
                                                of the Force.

                                        <p>The Cosmic Force moves in a span of eons. Pushing too hard usually requires turning
                                                to the dark side of the Force. That desire, that fear, is the reason for
                                                the fall. Best move carefully and let the Force move at its own pace.

                                        <p>So much can go so wrong. The Force is in a precarious balance. Perhaps it’s best
                                                to let a little suffering go unimpeded now so the future can be more certain.
                                                Perhaps this is safe, unless that future never comes.

                                                of the Force. The Mystic dives into conflict without hesitation, for there
                                                is no conflict, only the Force ebbing and flowing.

                                                invulnerable or correct at all times, they think the Force revolves around
                                                them. This egoism may cause a Mystic to make a fatal error and bring others

                                                can flow in one direction or another. When Mystics delve deep into the future,
                                                they may become paralyzed by the myriad of possibilities.

                                                merely drops in the pond. This frees them to act when needed without fear

                                        <p>While pride might seem dangerous, this is a pride in being part of something bigger,
                                                with a greater purpose. Prideful Mystics know they can make a change for
                                                the better.

                                                This may deceive Mystics into believing they are gods.

                                        <p>Mystics eschew credit and thanks. After all, anyone can do this work. This attitude
                                                ensures discipline and focus to the task at hand, and thus the Mystics focus
                                                on helping others and reducing suffering.

                                        <p>The Mystic turns self-deference into false modesty, denigrating themselves and
                                                expecting others to bolster their ego. A twisted passive-aggressiveness can
                                                emerge, in which the Mystic demands recognition for this modesty.

                                                them. Each instance is unique, even in the timelessness of the Cosmic Force.

                                                understand the magnitude of pain. This kind of insensitivity ignores the
                                                fact that pain, even when fleeting, ripples harm throughout time and space.

                                                and helping people. This feeling should be unconditional; they wish their

                                                of others, but their happiness doesn’t require others to act or think in
                                                a certain way. This allows Mystics to appreciate a person for who they are.
