                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Chemical/Biological Analysis</h2>
                <p>The Player Character identifies environmental problems from sources biological (alien flora and fauna,
                        viruses, bacteria) or chemical (toxic gases, poisons, heavy metals in the soil). The Engineer understands
                        that environments can damage delicate machinery, make it seize up, or cause it to perform under spec.
                        The environment can also affect the construction and destruction of structures, and harm or hinder
                        soldiers who have to march through the terrain.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Civilian Outreach</h2>
                <p>The PC believes that the Alliance fights for the civilians. That includes spearheading urban repair as
                        well as communicating with the local population to coordinate and establish supply agreements and
                        recruit new trainee mechanics. The Engineer’s work doesn’t change, merely the focus. Sometimes, Engineers
                        integrate themselves with the civilian populace to provide technological resources, work with them
                        in resisting the Empire, or prevent civilians from receiving retribution due to Alliance actions.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Disaster Relief</h2>
                <p>While similar to Civilian Outreach, Disaster Relief involves procuring and delivering medical supplies,
                        food, water, and temporary shelters after natural or artificial disasters. This PC destroys fallen
                        buildings to clear areas for traffic and repairs buildings to provide safe places to congregate.
                        Ground vehicles, ships, and droids need to be repaired or repurposed to handle rubble and tight urban
                        environments. These Engineers try to help get civilians’ lives back to normal.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Enviromental Manipulation</h2>
                <p>These PCs use their skills to alter the environment to clear the way or obstruct passage. This includes
                        constructing and destroying bridges, burrowing around natural and artificial obstructions, and improving
                        or impeding movement. These Engineers also manipulate the environment of outer space, exciting the
                        ions in a nebula to provide sensor cover or harnessing the electromagnetic core of an asteroid to
                        protect a fleet from a solar flare.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Field Training</h2>
                <p>The PC trains new Engineers and rank-and-file soldiers to use new and old specialty equipment. Some bases
                        schedule classes and provide classroom space so that Engineers can become full-time instructors.
                        Most Alliance outposts don’t have these luxuries, however, so Engineers teach by training in the
                        field. Field training includes teaching civilians with potential, either to assist their own communities
                        or to serve as contracted help for the Alliance.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Munitions</h2>
                <p>This includes the maintenance and use of ammunition and weapons that should detonate at the appropriate
                        time, or at least shouldn’t do so while within the soldier’s gun or vehicle. Work with munitions
                        also includes placing minefields, disarming explosives, and setting explosives to destroy environmental
                        obstacles or enemy fortifications. Those who work with vehicles, starships, or droids often modify
                        the machines to handle and use specialized munitions.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Research and Development</h2>
                <p>Engineers also partake in research and development for technologies and other applied solutions. Necessity
                        is the parent of invention, and every situation, enemy, and environment creates new necessities.
                        Research can include stealing technology from the enemy or finding it in a ruin. These characters
                        set aside time and resources to keep their base evolving, growing, and learning; that knowledge can
                        also be passed on to other Engineers at other bases.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Surveying the Enemy</h2>
                <p>This PC focuses on the technical aspects of scouting, the gathering of geographical knowledge, and the
                        mapping of data via the use of sensors, drones, droids, and satellites. This includes constructing
                        physical and electronic camouflage to hide a Rebel base and any vehicle movements from Empire scouts.
                        More destructive methods include eliminating similar enemy systems with electromagnetic devices,
                        damaging probes or satellites, and providing snipers and anti-aircraft ordnance data useful in targeting
                        enemy units.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Siege Engineering</h2>
                <p>Engineers often set up and build defensive fortifications (bunkers, trenches, and walls), artillery (gun
                        towers, and weapon reinforcements), and orbital defense platforms (ground attack satellites, anti-ship
                        satellites, and orbital flak). Natural formations such as caves, ancient temples, canyons, and even
                        asteroid fields can form the basis of an outpost. This PC emphasizes the importance of this kind
                        of constructive support in warfare.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Testing</h2>
                <p>The Alliance often must procure new supplies and technologies from less-than-reputable sources. This PC
                        tests first and tests often. The moment an Engineer neglects safety checks, device become a dangerous
                        uncertainty. Stolen Imperial technology also carries the risk of sabotage. This PC tests researched
                        technologies and methodologies in controlled labs, during live-fire exercises, and in the middle
                        of battle.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Transportation</h2>
                <p>This PC takes on the responsibility of establishing protected routes to and from a base and the front
                        lines. The Alliance uses a wide variety of transports, ranging from swift airspeeders, agile corvettes,
                        and blocky freighters to slow, wheeled haulers and even pack animals. The character might also recruit
                        private or public civilian transportation organizations. While an army marches on its stomach, this
                        PC would rather it rode instead.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Rescue and Recovery/Evac</h2>
                <p>This PC prepares and plans the logistics and execution of rescue operations of both civilians and military
                        personnel. While similar to the Transportation Duty, this work includes defense training, medical
                        support, survival training, observation, and rapid deployment operations. These Engineers live and
                        die by their comms; they need to communicate exactly where they and their personnel are and where
                        they need to be at a moment’s notice.
                </p>
