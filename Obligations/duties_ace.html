                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Air Superiority</h2>
                <p>The Player Character knows that keeping the skies clear of enemies is often a deciding factor in achieving
                        victory. PCs that pilot starfighters and airspeeders, operate ground-based anti-air emplacements,
                        or even hold the reigns of a flying beast are all dedicated to providing close air support and top
                        cover for ground forces, and denying the enemy the same advantage.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Intelligence</h2>
                <p>This PC knows that every victory hinges on having as much information as possible about the Empire's military
                        disposition and assets. He is driven to gather information on the Empire whenever possible. Sometimes,
                        this means something as bold as volunteering for a dangerous recon mission, but it also might just
                        mean making one last pass over a target after a daring raid so the onboard astromech can record the
                        enemy response.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Ground Superiority</h2>
                <p>No matter how good air support might be. battles are eventually decided on the ground. This PC knows that
                        taking out enemy infantry and armor in combat from turrets, armored walkers and speeders, mechanized
                        cavalry, and even traditional, mounted cavalry is what holds the line and wins the day. This PC is
                        always on the lookout for key enemy ground assets to disable and destroy.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Personnel</h2>
                <p>While arms, equipment, and vehicles are vital to the Rebellion, they are worthless without brave Rebels
                        willing to take them into battle against the Empire. This PC knows that the safety of his fellow
                        Rebels is the best long-term strategy for victory against the Empire, and it is the spirit of brotherhood
                        that keeps him invested in the fight. Aces with the Personnel Duty might volunteer for dangerous
                        escort missions, emergency evacuations, or close air support in heavy fire zones. This PC refuses
                        to leave anyone behind, and is often the first to volunteer to sacrifice himself if it means the
                        rest of his team can safely escape.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Placard Hunter</h2>
                <p>This PC seeks out the most skilled and famous Imperials on the battlefield, and takes them out head on.
                        These duels are often recorded and released on shadowfeeds as a part of Rebel propaganda efforts
                        to showcase how vulnerable the Empire is to Rebel assaults. Whether the PC sees this Duty as a means
                        of testing himself or a way to help larger Rebel efforts, he is likely to be seen abandoning his
                        mission objectives if a tempting enough target is fleeing the scene.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Recruiting</h2>
                <p>The Rebellion cannot survive without a steady influx of new personnel, and Rebel Aces are the proverbial
                        poster-children of the movement. This PC is always thinking of ways to bring talented beings to the
                        cause, and is always on the lookout for potential recruits. This might mean going to backwater races
                        and speaking with contestants, or freeing Imperial prisoners and convincing them to join up.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Resource Acquisition</h2>
                <p>Many Rebel strikes consist of launching a surprise attack, blasting every Imperial in sight, and then
                        jumping out again. This PC knows that if there is a way to steal the Imperial assets instead of just
                        destroying them, it makes for a much bigger Alliance victory. This PC is also always on the lookout
                        for potential Rebel sympathizers who might not be ready to openly join the Rebellion, but are able
                        to secretly funnel supplies and equipment to the cause.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Sabotage</h2>
                <p>This PC realizes that every Imperial asset destroyed is one that can't later be used against the Rebellion
                        or innocent civilians. The overall strategy of the Rebellion relies on sabotage and raids, and this
                        PC is fully committed to this plan of action. Whether or not to take another pass to hit one last
                        secondary objective or target of opportunity is not even a question for this PC. Imperial troops
                        without food, blaster gas. or supplies are easy pickings for the Rebels, and this PC aims to make
                        the Empire as weak as possible.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Space Superiority</h2>
                <p>This PC is dedicated to taking out enemy starfighters, turrets, capital ships, and platforms. He knows
                        that if the Rebels can showcase their strength in space combat, it could sway entire systems to their
                        cause.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Tech Superiority</h2>
                <p>As a stick jockey, this PC knows that while having the best-trained crew is the most important thing,
                        having that crew on the best combat platforms is a very close second. If not for Rebels focused on
                        maintaining tech superiority, the Alliance never would have acquired X-wings, or created the A-wing
                        or B-wing starfighters. These PCs are always looking to bring new designs, schematics, and the engineers
                        that create them back to base.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Support</h2>
                <p>The Rebel Alliance succeeds because of teamwork. From a vehicle, Aces are able to support missions by
                        providing escort, mission insertion and extraction, sensor data, communications, and more. This PC
                        is devoted to helping his fellow Rebels achieve their Duties by providing whatever assistance they
                        need. Although he may not get the same amount of reward or recognition as the people he is helping,
                        the PC has many more opportunities than his allies do to fulfill his Duty to the Rebellion.
                </p>
