                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Clear Skies</h2>
                <p>This PC recognizes the clanger that infantry units face from enemy air power. A pair of TIE fighters can
                        turn certain victory on the ground into disaster. This PC always has a plan to take out any enemy
                        air support, whether through the judicious use of portable launchers, jammers, camouflage, concealing
                        terrain, or even anti-air emplacement weapons.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Combat Victory</h2>
                <p>The PC wants to prove that the Rebellion’s armed forces can defeat the Empire in head-to-head battles,
                        and frequently pushes to launch devastating raids, ambushes, and strikes. This PC believes the only
                        path to victory is through combat, and that the rebels are more than a match for the Empire any time,
                        on any battlefield, under any conditions.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Internal Security</h2>
                <p>Of all the military branches in the Alliance, its army sees the most new recruits. The need for troops
                        is too great and resources too thin to properly vet the loyalty of every recruit. This PC knows that
                        one Imperial spy can potentially bring the entire movement down, and eyes all comrades-in-arms with
                        suspicion, regardless of individual history or deeds.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Intelligance</h2>
                <p>Knowledge is power, and this PC wants to know everything about the Empire. This Soldier seeks information
                        at every opportunity, copying Imperial datacores, setting up surveillance cams, or capturing enemy
                        droids for intel. The key to survival is avoiding the Empire where it is strong, hitting hard where
                        it is weak, and seeing the difference between the two.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Morale</h2>
                <p>While the troops of the Rebel Alliance know their cause to be just, the hopeless odds stacked against
                        them can be demoralizing. This PC knows that to have any hope of victory, the freedom fighters have
                        to keep their spirits up, and works to help with this via well-timed jokes or inspirational gestures
                        such as flying the Rebellion’s insignia on the battlefield.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Personnel</h2>
                <p>The PC epitomizes the military mantra of “no one left behind, " dragging wounded comrades to safety and
                        striving to get everyone home. This PC puts the lives of fellow Alliance personnel over everything,
                        including the mission.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Placard Hunter</h2>
                <p>This PC knows that without effective leadership, the rank and file troops of the Empire are easily dispatched.
                        In any fight, the Soldier seeks to eliminate the highest-ranking officers on the battlefield. At
                        worst, the remaining enemies fight in a much less coordinated fashion, but sometimes such losses
                        cause the foe to retreat.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Psychological Warfare</h2>
                <p>While the Imperial stormtroopers might appear fearless and disciplined, others within the Imperial Army
                        and Officer Corps aren’t as willing to die for the Emperor. Some PCs recognize that it is possible
                        to intimidate, confuse, or frighten an enemy to gain an advantage in an engagement, or avoid one
                        altogether.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Recruiting</h2>
                <p>Some Soldiers believe that if they just had a few more brave warriors, they could escalate their war with
                        the Empire, selecting targets more damaging to the Imperial war effort. PCs with the Recruiting Duty
                        always look to turn anyone into rebel sympathizers, and sympathizers into fellow members of the Alliance.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Resource Acquisition</h2>
                <p>The Rebel Alliance is always in desperate need of materiel in the fight against the Empire. Bacta, blaster
                        gas, and ration bricks win wars. This PC is always searching for sources of the raw materials, food,
                        clothing, weapons, armor, and other equipment the Alliance needs to continue the fight.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Sabotage</h2>
                <p>If the Rebellion can’t take something, denying the Empire its use is the next best thing. This PC knows
                        that Imperial forces are dependent on secure supply lines and storage depots, and destroying or disrupting
                        any link in the supply chain wreaks havoc with the effectiveness of Imperial troops.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Support</h2>
                <p>No soldier stands alone, and this PC focuses on standing beside comrades-in-arms. Only while working in
                        unison can the rebels hope to dent the seemingly invulnerable Galactic Empire. Although this PC might
                        not be as recognized or awarded honors as often as those he helps, his contribution is every bit
                        as vital, while helping other PCs pursue their Duties.
                </p>
