                                                into an ill-advised action. Letting fear guide oneâ€™s actions means never

                                                Pushing harder allows him to advocate for those who canâ€™t do so for themselves.

                                        <p>The character eschews credit and thanks. After all, anyone can do this work. This
                                                attitude ensures discipline and focus to the task at hand, and thus helping

                                        <p>The character turns self-deference into false modesty, denigrating himself and
                                                expecting others to bolster his ego. A twisted passive-aggressiveness can
                                                emerge, in which the character demands recognition for this modesty.

                                                support.
