                <h2 class="obligationHeader">Crew</h2>
                <p>The PC has an Obligation to keep a work crew or ship’s complement safe, healthy, and in work. Whether
                        or not the PC usually travels with the work crew, this character serves as a mediator between the
                        crew and outside individuals. The PC might owe the debt due from a time the crew saved the PC’s career
                        or even life through hard work and sacrifice.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="obligationHeader">Contract</h2>
                <p>The PC has a pressing contract to fulfill, whether it is legally binding or an informal deal. The contract
                        may be for providing, installing, or repairing technical items or on-call services. Fulfilling terms
                        of the contract reduces the character’s Obligation, while putting them off or incurring additional
                        expenses for the sake of fulfilling the contract might increase it.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="obligationHeader">Blackmail</h2>
                <p>Someone has discovered one of the PC’s dirty secrets through slicing or other technical means. The blackmailer
                        has possession of evidence damaging to the PC’s business, family, or organization. The evidence is
                        most likely stolen technical data, such as electronic records, holovid recordings, sensor data, maintenance
                        records, secret computer codes, or similar tech-related items. To keep the secret safe, the PC must
                        keep the blackmailer happy, possibly through payments or granting favors. The blackmailer is cunning
                        enough to maintain just enough of a threat to keep benefiting from the situation, but not so much
                        that the PC decides to allow the release of the evidence or to hunt down the blackmailer to permanently
                        put an end to the danger the information poses.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="obligationHeader">Bounty</h2>
                <p>The PC has an active bounty, earned during an attempt to expose the workings of a criminal or corrupt
                        organization. The PC might have acquired evidence of the organization’s misdeeds from databanks through
                        slicing or other technical skulduggery and then attempted to take the information public, whether
                        this meant presenting it to the authorities or broadcasting it via pirated HoloNet feed. The character’s
                        background and specialization can both provide additional ideas as to the reason for the bounty.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="obligationHeader">Criminal</h2>
                <p>The character has a criminal record or is accused of a crime (rightly or wrongly), most likely for using
                        technology illegally or providing the means for another to do so. Though the PC is not currently
                        in custody, there are outstanding warrants for the PC’s arrest. The PC might seek to settle this
                        Obligation by paying ongoing legal costs or fines, burying evidence, or convincingly demonstrating
                        innocence in the matter.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="obligationHeader">Debt</h2>
                <p>The PC owes someone a great deal, whether in money, goods, or services. The character may owe this group
                        or individual for loans used to pay for training, buy new equipment, or start a business. Paying
                        off the debt may be difficult due to the sheer credits value in question, as a result of the constant
                        accrual of interest that must be paid off, or because of both. The debt might even extend beyond
                        financial obligation, especially if the PC also has a personal relationship with the lender.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="obligationHeader">Failed Installation/Repair</h2>
                <p>A botched modification, installation, or repair job has publicly damaged the character’s reputation and
                        rendered the device, droid, or vehicle inoperable. The PC must take action to restore the damaged
                        item, and then find a way to socially engineer a return to good standing in the public eye.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="obligationHeader">Family</h2>
                <p>The character’s family demands great deal of time and attention, not just emotionally but also in some
                        technical capacity. The PC might be the only member of the family able to take care of vital machinery
                        that sustains the family’s livelihood, food, water, or even air supply, if they live on a space station
                        or in a hostile planetary environment. Though performing routine maintenance can help keep this Obligation
                        in check, the PC must seek to engineer a long-term solution—one that does not require constant personal
                        intervention—to remove this Obligation completely.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="obligationHeader">Favor</h2>
                <p>The character owes someone a big favor. Perhaps a government agent looked the other way after catching
                        the character slicing corporate computers. Perhaps a fellow Technician faked a malfunction or loss
                        of data to cover for a failure on the PC’s part. The magnitude of the favor is connected to the amount
                        of Obligation. The Obligation could take an extended amount of time to clear, as it might be reduced
                        by many small actions.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="obligationHeader">Unfinished Business</h2>
                <p>The PC is working on a long-term project such as a complex computer program or a light freighter refit.
                        It may be personal or commissioned work. While long breaks may be acceptable, the Obligation cannot
                        be totally fulfilled until the unfinished business is complete, and it weighs heavily on the PC’s
                        mind whenever the character chooses to postpone working on it for any reason.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="obligationHeader">Obsession</h2>
                <p>The PC has an unhealthy obsession with technology, droids, or computers that constantly interferes with
                        efforts to live a normal life. Whether it is repairing a prized droid, designing the next great piece
                        of cybernetic technology, or inventing a device that defines the era, the character has a continual
                        need to pursue this interest. Accomplishing significant tasks to further this goal helps to reduce
                        the character’s Obligation.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="obligationHeader">Responsibility</h2>
                <p>The character feels a strong sense of accountability to or responsibility for a person, place, or thing.
                        It might be to a business, social group, political movement, group of friends, or individual from
                        the PC’s past. The character might feel responsibility toward a mentor or an apprentice. Taking care
                        of major tasks that help fulfill this responsibility reduces the character’s Obligation.
                </p>
