                <h2 class="obligationHeader">Thrill Seeker</h2>
                <p>Some people are addicted to alcohol or chems, others to gambling or other seedy vices. This character,
                        however, is a confirmed adrenaline junkie, and chooses bounties not by their challenge or price,
                        but by how exciting or dangerous they are. Avoiding the Obligation—perhaps by being a responsible
                        business operator and considering every job’s cost benefit analysis—results in an almost immediate
                        case of excitement withdrawal. When inactive, the character is edgy, moody, easily distracted, and
                        generally unpleasant to be around.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="obligationHeader">Vigilante</h2>
                <p>The character has seen the wheels of justice grind up the innocent and let the guilty walk free. The character
                        has sworn to take the law—or a version of it, at any rate—and bring justice to those who deserve
                        it. When taking on contracts, this character tends to pursue the most hardened criminals.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="obligationHeader">Blackmail</h2>
                <p>Some group or individual has dirt on the character, and is using it to the greatest advantage possible.
                        Perhaps she killed another hunter and claimed the bounty, or maybe she is operating in the Core Worlds
                        without the required Imperial Peace-Keeping Certificate. Whatever the case may be, the blackmailer
                        wields an inordinate amount of power over the character. However this power is leveraged—money, favors,
                        services rendered—the character is subject to the blackmailer’s moods and whims, lest the dirty secret
                        become common knowledge.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="obligationHeader">Contract</h2>
                <p>A powerful and strict contract binds the character to a specific employer. This could be a crime boss,
                        an Imperial courtier, or a wealthy corporate CEO. Whoever holds the character’s contract has nearly
                        total control over the character’s future career. All bounties are furnished by the contract holder,
                        and deviating from the terms of the contract can lead to a number of potentially harsh fines and
                        punishments.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="obligationHeader">Rule Breaker</h2>
                <p>Either the character very publicly and flagrantly broke one of the rules laid down in the bounty hunter’s
                        code, or everyone wrongly believes she did. Whatever the case, this breach of the rules of the code
                        affects the character’s personal and professional life in a very real way. Contracts dry up, colleagues
                        refuse to speak to or help the character, or the character is treated in a condescending or irritatingly
                        sympathetic manner.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="obligationHeader">Debt</h2>
                <p>The character owes quite a bit of money to one or more individuals. This could be money owed to a shipyard
                        for some expensive modifications done to the character’s ship on credit, or funds put forth by a
                        patron who backed the character’s entry into the bounty hunters’ guild and expects to be repaid or
                        services rendered.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="obligationHeader">Betrayal</h2>
                <p>In the course of the job, the character has either suffered some kind of deep personal betrayal at the
                        hands of another bounty hunter, or is the perpetrator of such a betrayal. The betrayal affects the
                        character’s day to day life, whether through physical reminders, emotional scars, or some combination
                        of the two. If the character was the betrayer, the victim may come looking for answers, compensation,
                        or revenge at any moment.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="obligationHeader">Family</h2>
                <p>This hunter’s family holds an incredible influence over the character. Perhaps the PC comes from a long
                        line of bounty hunters, whose honor must be upheld. Alternately, the bounty hunter could also be
                        supporting a struggling family, and is always eager to pick up contracts to send money home.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="obligationHeader">Favor</h2>
                <p>The character owes a favor to someone in a position of power. However this favor came about, whether personally
                        or professionally, repayment of that favor is coming due with interest. This favor may be called
                        in all at once, or a little at a time, prolonging the character’s Obligation.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="obligationHeader">Criminal</h2>
                <p>The character has been accused of committing a crime during the collection of a legal bounty. This could
                        be anything from stealing a speeder in order to chase a fleeing fugitive, or interference with bonded
                        law enforcement to killing innocents during a shootout. Whatever the case, the constant threat of
                        discovery and incarceration hovers over the character. Whether the accusations are true is irrelevant;
                        the character has been accused and there is an outstanding warrant that makes the PC an appealing
                        target to other bounty hunters.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="obligationHeader">Keeper of the Faith</h2>
                <p>Much to many other freelancers’ amusement, this character has sworn to faithfully uphold both the spirit
                        and the letter of some code of honor. The PC believes very strongly in these edicts and adheres to
                        them with an almost religious fervor. The character never knowingly breaks any of the rules laid
                        down in the code, and may turn on colleagues who do so.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="obligationHeader">Fame</h2>
                <p>The character’s reputation casts a long shadow. Perhaps the PC took a famous and difficult bounty, or
                        owns a recognizable and deadly ship, or has beaten another well-known hunter to the punch in the
                        past. Whatever the case, it is hard for the character to move unnoticed throughout the galaxy. This
                        makes covert operations more difficult, but also means that informants are more likely to spill what
                        they know when the PC arrives.
                </p>
