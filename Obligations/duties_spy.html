                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Communications</h2>
                <p>Player Characters with this Duty understand that the Empire maintains its stranglehold on the galaxy via
                        a strong communications network. Whether working locally or across the galaxy, they specialize in
                        deciphering Imperial communications as well as in encrypting and concealing Rebel transmissions.
                        Often these PCs are on the forefront of innovative communication methods, such as using special patterns
                        on fabrics to alert agents of enemy activities or inserting code words into Imperial broadcasts to
                        pass secret messages to sleeper agents.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Anti-ISB Efforts</h2>
                <p>The Empire has a vast information network headed by the Imperial Security Bureau, or ISB. Characters with
                        this Duty focus their efforts on undermining this network with actions that specifically target the
                        ISB, such as feeding false information to its known moles, recovering captured prisoners from ISB
                        detention cells, developing profiles of ISB agents, and ensuring that the hated agency spends its
                        resources chasing dead-end leads.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Countermeasures</h2>
                <p>Characters with this Duty serve as cryptographers, secure communications specialists, and data manipulators.
                        Whether spreading false transmissions across subspace or the HoloNet, crafting new electronic protection
                        to keep Rebel data secure, or slicing into Imperial transmissions and data vaults, they are phantoms
                        in the code, capable of weaving digital misdirection while ensuring Rebel electronics remain secure.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Double Agent Recruitment</h2>
                <p>PCs selecting this Duty focus on turning Imperial personnel—especially its spies—into Rebellion assets.
                        By playing on the sentiments of those who remain idealistic about the betterment of the galaxy, they
                        gain valuable insight from individuals in positions of trust within the Empire. When that fails,
                        tactics such as blackmail, extortion, and other coercive efforts may be necessary in these desperate
                        times.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Droid Retasking</h2>
                <p>While the Empire seems to have an infinite number of organic beings in its service, droids also play a
                        critical role in almost all Imperial operations. PCs with this Duty focus their efforts on disabling
                        and reprogramming these droids to gather intelligence or even setting them against their Imperial
                        masters. By attacking this vulnerable and often￾overlooked Imperial resource, such PCs provide vital
                        aid to the Rebel Alliance.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Internal Security</h2>
                <p>Deceivers know their own kind. PCs with this Duty focus on protecting the Alliance from moles, double
                        agents, and traitors. They also help maintain safety by ensuring that strongholds, outposts, and
                        safe houses remain undetected by the Empire. This sometimes includes ensuring that supply lines for
                        these locations are maintained and kept secret.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Interrogation Resistance</h2>
                <p>Even the most skilled Rebel agent can be captured and subjected to Imperial interrogation. PCs with this
                        Duty specialize in ensuring that they and their fellow Rebels have the physical and mental fortitude
                        to endure interrogation. They also work to ensure that information critical to the Alliance is compartmentalized
                        and secure, so that agents who are unable to resist Imperial questioning don’t compromise the entire
                        Rebellion.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Legend Crafting</h2>
                <p>PCs selecting this Duty work to create fictitious histories and evidence to back up an infiltrating Spy’s
                        cover identity. Known as legends, these false histories help Spies assume a cover identity that becomes
                        a fully realized person and can be easily presented to others. These efforts usually also include
                        planting falsified information or doctored holos into Imperial databases, so that anyone researching
                        the Spy’s cover identity will find a host of data that corroborates the legend, enough to pass rigorous
                        examination.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Psychological Warfare</h2>
                <p>Fear is not only the purview of the Empire. PCs with this Duty attempt to spread fear among enemy forces
                        in an effort to weaken morale and destroy the discipline that is the hallmark of the Imperial Army
                        and Navy. They also regularly combat Imperial propaganda and look within the ranks of the Empire
                        itself for personnel who might easily be swayed into joining the Rebellion.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Resource Acquisition</h2>
                <p>Blasters and bacta are important for survival, but Spies with this Duty endeavor to acquire other resources
                        to aid the Alliance. These include enemy uniforms, Imperial credentials, and other tools of deception.
                        Spies with this Duty are certainly glad to acquire medical supplies, weapons, and other necessities,
                        but their skillset allows them to obtain equipment more suited to subtle missions.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Tactical Insight</h2>
                <p>Wars are sometimes won before a battle is ever fought. These PCs specialize in gathering information on
                        Imperial military tactics and using these secrets to exploit weaknesses in the Empire’s deployment
                        plans and combat strategies. They also attempt to undermine Imperial tactics by planting false intelligence
                        in Imperial battlefield reports or allowing fabricated reports on Rebel troop movements to “fall
                        into enemy hands."
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="dutyHeader">Wetwork</h2>
                <p>PCs with this Duty know that sometimes questionable, if not downright immoral, acts must be committed
                        in the name of the greater good. The quiet death of a single key individual, after all, can save
                        many lives or keep important secrets buried for good. They’re willing to do the unthinkable for the
                        cause, and eliminate or assassinate critical Imperial personnel to prevent or undo a greater evil.
                </p>
