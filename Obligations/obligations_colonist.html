                <h2 class="obligationHeader">Disgraced</h2>
                <p>The Colonist did something shameful, often some social taboo that isn't quite illegal. The shame and sideways
                        glances from peers have forced the Colonist to seek a new life where he can start over free of embarrassment.
                        The isolation of some colonies and cultures makes for some strange taboos not observed by the rest
                        of the galaxy. Thus the taboo can be something terrible, or something as benign as drinking from
                        a public fountain or showing a bare but innocuous body part.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="obligationHeader">Philanderer</h2>
                <p>Colonies tend to be small places, and if a being gets around, word about it has a tendency to follow close
                        behind. This Colonist has no shortage of scorned lovers still furious over his or her never committing.
                        Former flames have a habit of showing up at the worst moment, or causing delays when the chrono is
                        ticking. The worst is when two or more flings team up to make life miserable for a serial seducer,
                        or when spouses find out and decide the Colonist is deserving of punishment. Nothing is off limits,
                        as all is fair in love and war.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="obligationHeader">Exiled</h2>
                <p>Going up against politically connected members of the Galactic Empire is a good way to become exiled from
                        the most civilized of the Core Worlds. The Colonist is not allowed to set foot in the Core, or on
                        any Imperial-controlled worlds, but is desperate to remove the stain on his reputation. While possible,
                        the smallest misstep can be disastrous, setting progress back months or even years. There is also
                        the trouble of bureaucracy and last minute filing deadlines that can draw the character away.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="obligationHeader">Contracted</h2>
                <p>The Colonist has entered into a long-term contract with a corporation or government related to his work
                        at a colony. In many cases, these contracts are how colonists pay their passage to the new worldâ€”a
                        form of indentured servitude. Colonists might be contracted to provide bookkeeping, labor, or any
                        other number of services. Failure to live up to a contract can result in financial penalties, imprisonment,
                        deportation, or earning a bounty.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="obligationHeader">Bounty</h2>
                <p>This is a variant on the standard Bounty Obligation. The bounty may only be issued locally, without the
                        weight of the Empire behind it. These bounties are technically illegal, and attract ruthlessly competent
                        hunters independent of any guild or government. By changing their identity and hiding out in some
                        obscure backwater colony world, Colonists with this Obligation can avoid detection for years. However,
                        the level of violence these individuals can bring upon their town when the truly skilled bounty hunters
                        finally track them down can endanger the whole colony.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="obligationHeader">Debt</h2>
                <p>Aside from the running debt most Colonists have at the local cantina, unforeseen financial setbacks are
                        a regular part of life on a newly colonized world. All the expensive lessons for dealing with restless
                        natives, flora, fauna, or environmental conditions on that particular planet have yet to be learned.
                        Most times, the only way to stay afloat is by going to the deepest pockets in town and begging for
                        a loan.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="obligationHeader">Favor</h2>
                <p>A colony often begins life as a small community of a few thousand or even just a few hundred individuals.
                        When the only sentient life on an entire planet is that sparse, everyone depends on each other and
                        favors are as valuable as credits. Thirty fellow Colonists might have helped to build a school in
                        town for a Scholar for nothing more than a hot meal, some warm caf, and a favor. This might mean
                        helping get the herd in the pen before a storm, loaning credits, or any number of other odd jobs.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="obligationHeader">Family</h2>
                <p>Colonists often book passage to a colony world to start life anew for themselves and their families. For
                        these individuals, making certain their family is safe, healthy, and provided for trumps all other
                        concerns. A comm from home is just as likely to inspire as it is to devastate a Colonist riding herd
                        away from the homestead. Some Colonists have already lost members of their family, and instead are
                        beholden to a final promise, be i t to keep the ranch going or take on the role of family protector.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="obligationHeader">Responsibility</h2>
                <p>Colonists, especially those founding a new colony, each have a responsibility to the rest of their fellow
                        settlers. A character who is the only doctor on an entire planet cannot simply leave. Even going
                        away for a month could result in dozens of preventable deaths. A moisture farmer's nephew might have
                        a responsibility to keep condensers in the South Range operating, and runaway droids or not, if the
                        units aren't working by midday, there will be hell to pay. The colony only has a chance of survival
                        if everyone does his part .
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="obligationHeader">Witness Protection</h2>
                <p>Some Colonists never would have chosen life on a distant backwater, but authorities have deemed it necessary
                        to hide them in the witness protection program. The Colonist is being hunted by the Hutt Cartels,
                        Black Sun, the Tenloss Syndicate, or some other galactic-scale criminal organization as a material
                        witness. The Colonist was given a new identity and sent to an obscure planet to safely await trial,
                        but the syndicate won't stop looking for him.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="obligationHeader">Pacifist</h2>
                <p>This Colonist abhors violence, either out of a sense of morality or cowardice. Witnessing a violent act
                        can incense or fluster a character so much that he is unable to think straight or control his shaking
                        hands, or simply disgust him to the point that he can't interact with his fellows. If this obligation
                        triggers and the PC participates in a violent act , the GM may add &#9632 to any skill checks he makes
                        for the remainder of the session. (This may be avoided through good roleplaying on the player's part
                        , such as having his character always try to talk his way out of a fight, and if he's forced to do
                        battle, only use weapons that stun or incapacitate his opponents)
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2 class="obligationHeader">Frontier Justice</h2>
                <p>Life on the frontier is harsh, cruel, and unfair. Bandits and outlaws can get away with murder and more
                        if the local sheriff is too weak to stop them. Some people are able to let that go and move past
                        it. When the dead are loved ones, however, some can't just move on. The need to get even is so strong
                        it dominates the Colonist's thoughts and dreams, causing him to obsess about the moment of exacted
                        vengeance. The Colonist gladly betrays, abandons, or hurts anyone if it brings him closer to settling
                        the score.
                </p>
