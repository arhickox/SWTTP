                                        <p>The character's bravery is quite remarkable. Whether facing down a charging rancor
                                                or racing into a burning building to save innocents, he is always willing
                                                to take risks to help others.

                                        <p>Hot blood, however, can easily lead to hot tempers. The character is quick to
                                                anger, and what he cannot deal with face-to-face can often frustrate him
                                                to the point of rage.

                                        <p>The character has an open heart. While he may hold a special place in his heart
                                                for his companions or a significant other, he tends to genuinely like most
                                                individuals he meets. His love for others can make him charming and affable,
                                                and exceedingly tolerant.

                                        <p>Love, if not given selflessly, can quickly turn to jealousy. The character's personality
                                                tends toward envy if his love is not reciprocated, or sometimes he simply
                                                envies others’ accomplishments or possessions.

                                        <p>The character possesses commendable prudence, willing to always look before he
                                                leaps into a new situation. His forward-thinking ways may have saved his
                                                fellows from dangerous situations on numerous occasions.

                                        <p>The line between caution and fear is a thin one. Sometimes the character spends
                                                too much time concerned about the potential problems of a situation to act
                                                in that situation at all. At other times, his caution causes him to flee
                                                when danger presents itself, through bolder action might reap real rewards.

                                                tasks, even mundane ones, with excitement. He’s not one to overthink a situation,
                                                lest he miss a great new opportunity.

                                                he comes across. His compassion may lead to self-sacrifice in order to aid

                                        <p>Pride can be a powerful emotion, and can push a character to impressive feats
                                                of personal accomplishment. He strives to be the best and to take pleasure

                                        <p>Pride, among all emotions, is perhaps the easiest to fall to a darker form. Arrogance
                                                mirrors pride, but satisfaction in one’s accomplishments is replaced with
                                                contempt for others’ failings. It is not enough to succeed; the character
                                                also expects all others to fail.
