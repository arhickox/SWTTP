                        <div class="card-body">
                                <p class="card-text">Every city has its secrets, and every shining beacon of civilization
                                        has its seedy underworld. Within these shadowy depths, miscreants and malcontents
                                        prey on the helpless, committing heinous crimes and leaving misery and chaos in their
                                        wake.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Most law enforcement agencies try to combat criminals without violating
                                        the very laws the agencies exist to uphold. Thus, their agents must abide by strict
                                        regulations that restrain their behavior. Even institutions that exist to uphold
                                        evil laws, such as the Empire, have codes of conduct that apply to their enforcers.
                                        The Sentinel, however, plays by his own rules.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">During the time of the Old Republic, the Jedi Sentinels were Force adepts
                                        who blended combat expertise and training in the Force with a more pragmatic approach
                                        to their duties. Sentinels embraced practical technologies and utilized techniques
                                        borrowed from police forces, skip tracers, spies, and even lawbreakers. Sentinels
                                        relied on quick thinking and cunning to accomplish their tasks, and they quickly
                                        found their calling in the depths of urban environments. On the streets, Sentinels
                                        could fight criminals by using their own tactics against them.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Such an approach was not without risk. Even as Sentinels skirted the
                                        law to enforce justice, they skirted the dark side of their own morality as well.
                                        A Sentinel had to maintain constant vigilance over his own actions, analyzing each
                                        choice he made to ensure it was the right one. The best Sentinels avoided falling
                                        to the dark side by cultivating a fierce intellect and a brilliant cunning—to see
                                        all sides of a no-win situation and find the unexpected solution.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Although the Empire has long since wiped out the Jedi Order, and with
                                        it the Jedi Sentinels, some remain who follow these guiding principles. Many quickwitted
                                        Force-sensitives living in urban areas find themselves unconsciously adopting a Sentinel’s
                                        tactics as they unlock their own hidden potential.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Characters with a strong moral imperative may see these crusading skills
                                        as a means of investigating powerful individuals If they find powerful villains who
                                        are above the law, then employing less ethical approaches might be the only means
                                        to bring these rogues to justice. Under these circumstances, a Sentinel could readily
                                        justify deception and even minor crimes if they were undertaken to assure that a
                                        tyrant’s excesses could be curbed.</p>
