                                <p class="card-text">Characters who follow the Mystic career are typically born to accept
                                        this mantle. From the time they first open their eyes, a strong connection to the
                                        Force colors their perception of the world surrounding them. They constantly perceive
                                        the ebb and flow of its energies between all living things. To many Mystics, the
                                        Force is as important a guide and mentor as their family and trusted friends. It
                                        teaches them to trust their instincts more than any training or instruction, for
                                        those instincts come from the Force.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Because Mystics dwell so deeply in the Force, they often learn to master
                                        a broad range of Force powers. Training and practice can, of course, enhance their
                                        aptitude, but not all of them require a teacher. Rather, many Mystics simply intuit
                                        their powers through experience and their connection to the Force. Many Mystics accept
                                        this as the natural way of things. They strongly believe that the Force guides and
                                        provides for them as long as they remember to remain open and aware of its presence.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Many Mystics come from a culture where their connection to the Force
                                        has made them a person of importance. In some instances, they might have served as
                                        an advisor or even a magistrate. In other cases, their role could have been more
                                        religious or shamanic. They are likely to expect a certain degree of deference because
                                        of I their previous experiences. This means many Mystics develop a powerful charisma
                                        and captivating presence. Some Mystics come by this naturally, able to convince others
                                        of what they have seen using soft words and persuasive arguments. Others work tirelessly
                                        to develop these personality traits, knowing that a compliment (or even a lie) in
                                        the right ear at the right time can quickly advance their goals.</p>
