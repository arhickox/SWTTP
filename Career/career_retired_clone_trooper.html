                                <p class="card-text">Literally bred for battle, these warriors were the bulk of the Republic’s
                                        fighting force in the Clone Wars. Exceptionally trained, they were invaluable allies
                                        to the Jedi Order until they were manipulated into betraying its members. As the
                                        clones’ accelerated aging process continues unabated, their life spans are reaching
                                        their ends, but they remain effective, tactically minded warriors whom none should
                                        underestimate.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Player Characters who take this universal specialization must be human
                                        males, given that they were once clone troopers, but gain a wider set of career skills
                                        from their Kaminoan training. Such PCs have seen too much of war, but realize that
                                        the Empire cannot be stopped unless they lend their skills to the battle.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Clone troopers were grown on Kamino using the human bounty hunter Jango
                                        Fett as their genetic template. These clones were engineered with an accelerated
                                        growth rate in order to become effective combatants in a significantly reduced period
                                        of time, and they had inhibitor chips installed to prevent unintended violent outbursts—or
                                        at least that was the official reason. While the troopers developed, they were given
                                        extensive generic combat training in addition to specific training as pilots, gunners,
                                        shock troopers, and a variety of other specializations. Possessing the ability for
                                        creative thought, clone troopers were significantly more effective than the mass-produced,
                                        programmed droids they were sent to combat.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">During the Clone Wars, clone troopers became battle brothers; after
                                        surviving countless battles together, they established a fierce loyalty not only
                                        for each other but also for their Jedi generals. Without the contributions of both
                                        clone troopers and Jedi, the Republic would have had no chance of winning. The bond
                                        appeared unbreakable to all.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Near the end of the war, though, Chancellor Palpatine branded the Jedi
                                        as traitors and ordered the clone troopers to eliminate their Jedi comrades, no questions
                                        asked—and they did. Almost no Jedi or Padawans survived. Soon afterward, due to their
                                        accelerated aging, the clone troopers were decommissioned and replaced with non-clone
                                        stormtroopers, who lacked their intensive training. Once retired, some clone troopers
                                        were horrified about their execution of Order 66. A few went as far as removing their
                                        inhibitor chip, blaming it for making them follow the order, since troopers who had
                                        removed it beforehand did not carry out the order.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Today, a handful of these soldiers still survive and grapple with the
                                        consequences of their actions. Whether due to shame for their role in Order 66, anger
                                        against the Empire, or a desire to continue to fight for their Clone Wars ideals,
                                        a few have abandoned their leisure to fight in the nascent rebellion.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Retired Clone Troopers are powerful allies despite their age. Not only
                                        do they retain their tactical combat knowledge and training, but they have striven
                                        to maintain their genetically imbued physical conditioning as well. This is enhanced
                                        by the practical skills derived from their years of fighting and winning battles.
                                        As former soldiers of both the Republic and the Empire, they also know the location
                                        of multiple abandoned military bases scattered across the galaxy. Experience is power,
                                        and Retired Clone Troopers are steeped in it.
