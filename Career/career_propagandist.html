                                <p class="card-text">The Propagandist sways opinion as a master of spin, turning over every
                                        proverbial stone to find rumors, then adding a healthy dose of half-truths. Propagandists
                                        also possess the unique ability to boost the Duty that their allies earn by controlling
                                        how word of their deeds of heroism spreads across the Rebel Alliance. This makes
                                        a Propagandist a significant asset to any unit, whether it works on the front, in
                                        back rooms where crucial negotiations are conducted, or deep behind enemy lines.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Truth is often a matter of perspective, and Propagandists serve the
                                        Rebel Alliance by skewing this perspective in favor of their cause. To the Propagandist,
                                        truth is just as much worth pursuing as it is worth manipulating. Whether simply
                                        leaking the right facts to shift public opinion or creating outright fabrications
                                        to demoralize the enemy, a Propagandist understands the power of perception.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Propagandists leverage Perception to uncover the truth and use Charm
                                        or Deception to spin it to benefit the Rebel Alliance. Some Propagandists focus more
                                        on either weaving compelling rhetoric or telling believable lies, while others prefer
                                        to gain ranks in Charm and Deception equally, giving them maximum flexibility.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Propagandists play an important role in the Galactic Civil War. Even
                                        as the battles rage on and above many oppressed worlds, the Rebel Alliance wages
                                        an equally important struggle for the support of the galactic citizenry. While the
                                        Empire’s evil is obvious to most, few possess the courage to stand against such a
                                        brutal enemy. Propagandists must sway these people, distributing persuasive information
                                        as far and wide as possible, inspiring heroism in everyday citizens.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Ideally, a Propagandist reveals truths that the Empire would conceal:
                                        galactic atrocities, corruption, and the terrible cost of its policies. However,
                                        few Propagandists deal strictly in truth as such, more likely distributing misinformation
                                        to enrage the oppressed. Criticizing the ethics of such tactics is difficult when
                                        they serve the cause so effectively. Propagandists might argue that small lies expose
                                        much greater truths that the Empire tries to conceal. For some, news is as much a
                                        business as a political pursuit, while for others, propaganda is of paramount importance.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">In a group of Player Characters, a Propagandist can act as a master
                                        of information collection, interviewing civilians and even military personnel for
                                        rumors and secrets. Perhaps even more importantly, by planting information in the
                                        right ears, a skilled Propagandist can demoralize enemies, manipulating them into
                                        believing untruths. For this, a Propagandist is well served bv a high Cunning and
                                        a high Presence.</p>

                                                organizations such as FloloNet News. Propagandists who have left such posts
                                                are especially valuable to the Rebellion, as they know the Empire’s tactics

                                                closely often become personally engaged in them, and this is especially true
                                                for those working with the oppressed. A Propagandist who has recorded the
                                                trials and suffering of a minority usually becomes involved in helping that
                                                group in some way. Frequently, that means joining the Rebel Alliance to help

                                                have designed HoloNet advertisements or even billboards. While the Rebel
                                                Alliance does not typically display itself so openly, an eye for presentation
                                                can go a long way to selling a message.</li>

                                                apply their studies to political ideologies as well, and because of the Empire’s
                                                totalitarian and repressive regime, no few of these critics have thrown in
