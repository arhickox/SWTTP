                                        that each Commodore given one to command has earned tremendous respect and trust.
                                        Even those Commodores who are not actually captains of particular ships, instead
                                        operating in another key support role, have demonstrated great gifts for strategic
                                        thinking and resource management on a large scale.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">In addition to maintaining extraordinary calm in stressful situations
                                        and providing strong guidance to those around him, a Commodore is best served by
                                        understanding the incredibly technical aspects of navigating the stars and managing
                                        the crucial resources of his ship.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Commodores tend to spend very little time on any planet, having chosen
                                        a path placing them firmly in the stars with hard ship decks under their feet. They
                                        relish both the daily challenge of keeping a ship and its crew operating at peak
                                        capacity and facing the strategic challenges of capital ship engagements. The greatest
                                        Commodores find themselves managing not just a single ship, but a fleet of them,
                                        matching wits against their enemy counterparts in a huge game with very deadly consequences
                                        for each and every piece in play.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Effective Commodores are even more precious than Pilots for the Alliance
                                        Navy. Anyone showing a capacity for the role likely finds himself groomed heavily
                                        for eventual command. The Rebellion faces the might of the Imperial Navy with but
                                        a fraction of the tonnage in capital ships, so each one must be commanded by the

                                                are plentiful the galaxy over, especially in areas of commerce and intersystem
                                                trade. Though their experience in space battles may be lacking, or limited

                                                latent talents in leadership and ship-to-ship tactics. A great many Rebel
                                                Commodores are drawn from this large pool of individuals, perhaps even using
                                                their own ships and crews to help forge victory for the Rebel Alliance.</li>

                                                lose their vessels to the enemy. Their ships are either captured, perhaps
                                                by pirates, or destroyed in military action due to poor decisions or tactical
                                                blunders. Each such loss is a disgrace that must somehow be atoned for, whether
                                                the failure was the Commander’s fault or the result of an unfortunate series
                                                of events. While failure to lead on the ground might lead to a handful of
                                                deaths, the loss of a starship results in hundreds, sometimes thousands,
                                                of casualties. The weight of such a burden is difficult to bear, but one
                                                must learn to live with it if one is to strive for better days ahead.</li>
