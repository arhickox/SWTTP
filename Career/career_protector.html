                                <p class="card-text">Guardians are often driven by their compassion for the plights of those
                                        who cannot protect themselves. Protectors ensure these innocents never come to harm.
                                        Few are tougher than a Protector, and even fewer can get through his guard to attack
                                        those he defends. Even if his charges do suffer harm, the Protector possesses basic
                                        medical knowledge to heal their wounds.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Protectors are able to use thier skill set to assist those who are in
                                        need during a crisis. These skills complement many of the talent selections, so that
                                        the Protector remains capable of effectively shielding others from suffering harm
                                        without sacrificing his own capabilities.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Protectors could be considered bodyguards, but their efforts are seldom
                                        limited to protecting a single individual. Instead, Protectors are more likely to
                                        defend the needy on a larger scale. Often, they function as rescue workers, using
                                        their medical knowledge to stabilize injuries in the field and then providing additional
                                        protection. In other cases, Protectors may shelter refugees or other victims fleeing
                                        terrible situations, holding the line until the innocents can escape to safety. When
                                        a Protector does defend a single individual, it is likely because a great threat—even
                                        another Force user—pursues the person.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Some Protectors might come to master their abilities while working in
                                        a military or law enforcement role. Some Force techniques might manifest spontaneously
                                        as they instinctively act to keep companions safe. This could be particularly relevant
                                        for individuals who have not recognized their connection to the Force. Its presence
                                        might enable them to save an ally from danger in a seemingly inexplicable fashion.
                                        However, once these individuals realize the power they have, they must decide whether
                                        to continue their career and keep it a secret, or leave the life they’ve known and
                                        explore their new abilities.</p>

                                                A Protector might be a little of both—the heir to a long line of bodyguards,
                                                raised from birth to be a guide, companion, and champion who takes charge
                                                in dangerous situations. Is this current mission an order from the Protector’s
                                                charge? Or is it atonement for a broken oath or a past failure to save someone?

                                                bolt for someone else and lived to tell about it. As a bodyguard for high-profile
                                                targets, the character might have accrued notoriety, both by association
                                                and through courageous actions. Such a character might take pride in shrugging
                                                off hits that would fell lesser beings, or might humbly credit luck for such
                                                successes. Whatever the Protector’s attitude, keeping others from harm is
                                                always a top priority. If getting the enemy’s attention is the best way to
                                                do that, then so be it.

                                                the criminal underworld than in the galaxy at large. A Protector of this
                                                background might once have sworn to defend an outlaw, for money or out of
                                                a sense obligation. This supposed criminal might have been innocent (or at
                                                least sympathetic), but this person might alternatively have been genuinely
                                                evil. Maybe the Protector saved the life of a true villain long ago and has
                                                come to regret it in the intervening years. Perhaps the Protector still serves
                                                a wicked master out of a sense of loyalty that supersedes personal opinions
                                                on right and wrong.

                                                keeping a charge safe requires the pair to stay on the move. If a Protector
                                                is shielding a fugitive targeted by powerful enemies, mobility would be
                                                a necessity, and trying not to leave deep footprints would be a top priority.
                                                A character so dedicated to a single person’s safety might see everything
                                                as a threat, and relearn how to react appropriately to mundane situations.
