                                <p class="card-text">As the Clone Wars erupt across the galaxy, there are
                                        many beings who have no interest in which side
                                        wins or loses. Scavengers have always existed in the
                                        Outer Rim, but during wartime, any individual might
                                        find themself lurking among the wreckage of droids
                                        and vehicles, salvaging valuables. For this reason, sentients from all walks of life might become Scavengers
                                        and learn to turn damaged or forgotten technology
                                        into profit on the black market,
                                        whether dealing in individual
                                        scanners and blasters or salvaging entire starships.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">To venture out into a ruinous battlefield requires
                                        great courage, and only the most daring survivalists succeed at deriving profit from the wreckage of
                                        warfare. The dangers of a former battleground—from
                                        shattered tanks and unstable munitions to not-quite-disabled battle droids—are enough of a deterrence
                                        that most Scavengers find themselves working alone.
                                        The isolation and danger give anyone who chooses
                                        such a life great tenacity. The pay is usually better
                                        than the rate for any other work they could find, and
                                        the freedom is liberating.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">It is the ability to find treasure within the detritus
                                        of the Republic and the Separatists that draws individuals to such dangerous endeavors. A Scavenger is
                                        a master of improvisation. They often refurbish the
                                        technology they find in new and innovative ways to
                                        either sell on the black market or use for their own
                                        purposes. They are as much inventors as they are
                                        survivors, creating handmade and unique equipment
                                        that only they know how to use.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Not all of a Scavenger’s discoveries are from the
                                        wreckage of war, however. Occasionally a battle
                                        unearths ancient relics or technology from before
                                        even the Republic, or a tip or rumor puts a Scavenger’s
                                        skills to the test as they venture into territory unseen
                                        for generations. Instead of recovering the wreckage of
                                        a Republic or Separatist war machine, they may find
                                        themselves in the possession of a device so old that it
                                        would be priceless to academics or religious leaders—
                                        a device that can do things that no other technology
                                        can replicate.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">If a Scavenger doesn’t find their own use for a broken hull or circuit board, an extensive network within
                                        the black market offers plenty of ways to turn a profit
                                        on it. For every innovator willing to venture into danger for their parts, there are a dozen smugglers and
                                        technicians who would rather trade credits for safety
                                        and buy whatever materials a Scavenger can recover.
                                        This means that every piece of tech or wreckage is
                                        potentially valuable to someone. A reliable Scavenger
                                        can build up relationships with experienced fences
                                        that lead to improved profits and information that
                                        wouldn’t be available any other way.</p>
