                                        and beyond (and turn a serious profit from it) are Traders. For a Trader, a new planet
                                        represents nigh-infinite potential for resource exploitation, while a new culture
                                        or hidden community is a customer base just begging for his particular talents.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Most Traders know how to build connections between the center of civilization
                                        and the far reaches, and they are often educated folks who bring knowledge and proficiency
                                        in economics, sociology, and politics with them.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Traders are exceptionally adept at commerce, naturally; they know how
                                        to find what is needed, and can usually bypass the kinds of restrictions that stymie
                                        others. At the same time, Traders can get the most out of a transaction, as well
                                        as talk themselves into or out of almost anything. Traders are strategic thinkers,
                                        planning ahead for contingencies. They are also strong-willed, making them excellent
                                        companions in a crisis.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">A Trader played in a campaign will likely serve as the group's public
                                        face, though not necessarily as the leader. He will be one of the best first choices
                                        for interacting with public officials, money men, and anyone with whom the group
                                        seeks to do business. When it comes to finding and buying something that the team
                                        needs, or fencing something that they wish to get rid of for a profit, he is invaluable.</p>
