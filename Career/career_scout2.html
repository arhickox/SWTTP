                                <p class="card-text">Before an army dares commit its forces to action, it must know where
                                        the enemy is, what that enemy is doing, and what the conditions of the area of operations
                                        are. Additionally, military forces require constant updates on possible future sites
                                        for operations. Rebellions like that being conducted by the Alliance are in continual
                                        need of contingency locations for new bases as the Empire relentlessly tracks down
                                        existing headquarters. Scouts are the vital source of this information.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The ability to travel to and on planets is essential to Scout operations,
                                        and Scouts are trained to survive in the worst conditions while missing nothing with
                                        their information gathering efforts.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Most Scouts tend to be loners, or else are used to working with a very
                                        small group. The ability to slip into and out of a system unnoticed is the key to
                                        their success and survival, and most Scouts are accustomed to going long stretches
                                        of time without direct contact with their command structure. Not surprisingly, most
                                        Scouts develop fairly independent streaks and personality quirks, making them ill-suited
                                        to general military service. At the same time, Scouts often develop a profound love
                                        of travel and an appreciation for the diverse beauty of the galaxy.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Alliance depends heavily on its Scouts for survival. The Scouts'
                                        instincts and vigilance are far better than any technical alert system for warning
                                        when Imperial forces are closing in. When one base is threatened with annihilation
                                        by the might of the Empire's massive navy, packing up and heading to a new one can
                                        only happen because a Scout found the ideal location for a new base months ago. As
                                        part of a diverse team working for the Rebellion, a Scout is often the one determining
                                        where to go for a mission and how best to get there.</p>

                                                missions, and are especially useful in urban areas.</li>
