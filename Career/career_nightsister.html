                                <p class="card-text">The sect known as the Nightsisters studies the Force in
                                        a much different way than the Jedi or even the Sith.
                                        The unique magickal ichor on Dathomir grants power
                                        and wisdom to those strong—or cruel—enough to
                                        wield it. In general, the Nightsisters consolidate
                                        and collect power, both through alchemy and
                                        magicks and through self-reliance and personal strength.
                                        </p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Nightsisters also differ from
                                        the Jedi through their use of alchemy, the concentration of the Force
                                        into a physical form. They study the
                                        effects of the Force on the strange
                                        creatures on Dathomir, extracting
                                        utility from how these creatures
                                        express the Force. For example, an
                                        ancient creature called the Sleeper
                                        has properties the Nightsisters use
                                        to create their Water of Life, a form
                                        of healing alchemy.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">This study differs from the Jedi’s
                                        aspiration for knowledge and the
                                        Sith’s hunger for power. Nightsisters use anything and everything
                                        on Dathomir to assist in their
                                        survival. They view the animals, the trees, the waters,
                                        their energy bows, and
                                        even the Nightbrothers as tools that help
                                        their clans endure. They bend or
                                        break those tools
                                        when they need to
                                        without remorse, pity,
                                        or regret. In many ways,
                                        by relying on such tools, the
                                        Nightsisters avoid falling into the
                                        passions and rages that plague
                                        the Sith, while wielding the dark
                                        side of the Force that the Jedi
                                        fear to tap.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Individualism manifests in many different beliefs
                                        among the Nightsisters. Some Nightsisters
                                        believe in a Winged Goddess, a deity
                                        of life, divination, and fertility. Others believe in a Fanged
                                        God, deity of death and
                                        the hunt. To the Nightsisters, life consists of a series
                                        of challenges and moments
                                        of suffering, tempering and
                                        strengthening their bodies and souls. Death, though
                                        not celebrated, is
                                        not feared, being
                                        merely a natural
                                        part of existence.
                                        Still, to the Nightsisters, the boundary
                                        between the living
                                        and the dead is merely
                                        a veil, not a wall.
                                        </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Mother Talzin’s clan has a variation on hanging coffins. The dead are sealed and
                                        stitched into large leather pods dangling
                                        from trees, signifying rebirth, the continual
                                        presence of death, and integration into the
                                        ecosystem. With practice, a Nightsister
                                        can commune with the dead and gain
                                        wisdom and even summon them to the
                                        material world. In this and in all things,
                                        the Nightsisters integrate their magicks
                                        into their cultural practices and utilize
                                        those practices to ensure their survival.
                                        </p>
                                <p class="card-text">While the Jedi and Sith might
                                        view the Nightsisters as agents
                                        of the dark side, the Nightsisters
                                        care little about the war between
                                        the two groups. The Nightsisters
                                        know no serenity or peace like
                                        the Jedi, yet they do not give in
                                        to rage or overt passion like the
                                        Sith. Instead, they freely cross
                                        the line between light and
                                        dark, embroiled in and thriving in conflict.
                                        </p>
