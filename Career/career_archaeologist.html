                                <p class="card-text">Though Archaeologists have a strong focus on their scholastic pursuits
                                        and understanding of history, they tend to have a rough-and-tumble approach to dealing
                                        with the inevitable challenges they are likely to face in the held.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Most Archaeologists believe very passionately that what they do is noble
                                        and important to the people of the galaxy. They tend to be less concerned with who
                                        is currently in charge, except for how the prevailing policies of the current government
                                        impact their studies and digs. Unfortunately for the current state of the held, the
                                        Empire tends to take a very heavy hand in matters of "revisionist history," preferring
                                        to alter findings to best fit its agendas. As such, most Archaeologists either work
                                        outside of Imperial channels or wish they did.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Player Character Archaeologists can easily be the centerpiece of a new
                                        campaign, building a team of other specialists to help in a recently embarked-upon
                                        expedition. Otherwise, -'such a character may be between digs and looking either
                                        for an expedition to join or "filler work" until he can make the right kinds of contacts.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Perhaps an archaeology-oriented Explorer joins a group that's journeying
                                        to an area for completely different reasons; he trades his skills and knowledge for
                                        the chance to investigate rumors of a potentially valuable find once he gets to where
                                        they are going.</p>

                                        <li><b class="bold-gold">Academic: </b>Archaeologists inherently possess a scholarly
                                                background, making this almost a default part of any history for a character
                                                of this type. The study of history, ancient civilizations, and related topics
                                                requires a great deal of in-depth research and academic focus before taking
                                                a single step into the held. Simply put, no Archaeologist is going to be
                                                worth a gundark's broken tooth if he doesn't start out with at least some
                                                academic foundation.</li>

                                        <li><b class="bold-gold">Criminal: </b>Archaeologists are not always of pure heart
                                                and noble of purpose. More than a few see uncovering ancient artifacts as
                                                a means to financial reward, and they are willing to break both taboos and
                                                laws to get what they want. They will sell to the highest bidder, even if
                                                it means a priceless heirloom goes hidden into some greedy aristocrat's vault
                                                instead of being shared with the galaxy. Then again, an Archaeologist doesn't
                                                necessarily have to possess a dark heart to become a criminal; just poking
                                                into the wrong tomb on the wrong planet at the wrong time can set him on
                                                the fugitive's path.</li>
                                        <hr class="background_hr">
                                        <li><b class="bold-gold">Entrepreneur: </b>Archaeologists are not usually entrepreneurs
                                                at heart, but there are plenty who follow that calling who are more than
                                                happy to find ways to make money at it. Ancient civilizations—and the knowledge,
                                                technology, and potential secrets of power they hold—are highly valuable
                                                to governments, corporations, and other factions. Like a Scout, a savvy Archaeologist
                                                may well put a solid team together to go out and find treasures that can
                                                net a tidy profit.</li>

                                        <li><b class="bold-gold">Ex-Imperial Operator: </b>Archaeologists are often employed
                                                by the Empire to find and uncover the knowledge and secrets of the countless
                                                civilizations that existed prior to the Empire. Such knowledge may need to
                                                be suppressed, of course, should it not fall in line with the current propaganda,
                                                yet it is still important to know everything possible about the planets and
                                                cultures absorbed. Some such Archaeologists may find the suppression of their
                                                life's work too much to take, thus seeking to strike out on their own to
                                                find and reveal the truths they discover. Perhaps one such Archaeologist
                                                may discover rumors and evidence of a powerful ancient culture that directly
                                                undermines Imperial doctrine and, knowing the Empire will do all it can to
                                                wipe any trace of the offending culture out, he decides to break out on his
                                                own to get there first.</li>

                                        <li><b class="bold-gold">Fallen Noble: </b>Archaeologists are inherently well educated,
                                                which is also true of the aristocracy in many cultures. Archaeology is a
                                                favorite pastime of the rich and powerful, so a noble who is fallen from
                                                grace might find that what was once a passionate hobby is now an option for
                                                making a living. A possible twist on that theme is a noble who, due to his
                                                obsession with rumors of a great lost treasure, finds himself on the outs
                                                with his family. To redeem himself, he sets out among the stars to prove
                                                them all wrong and return to even greater heights.</li>

                                                of wandering. As a restless soul traveling the Rim, coming across ancient
                                                ruins and hidden places as his feet took him there, someone could develop
                                                a keen interest to uncover and learn more. It may make for an interesting
                                                story should a group go looking for a particular site of ruins and are repeatedly
                                                told to find the "grungy guy with the strange metal pole" who wanders through
                                                the area regularly, speaking often about his latest finds.</li>
