                        <div class="card-body">
                                <p class="card-text">Though they spend most of their lives struggling to avoid Imperial entanglements,
                                        keeping their ships flying, dodging blaster fire, and having enough to eat, Smugglers
                                        are often seen as the freest beings in the galaxy. They travel the hyperspace lanes,
                                        system to system, planet to planet, bringing what people want and need (and cannot
                                        get through legitimate means).</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Unfortunately, that freedom is often an illusion; many Smugglers find
                                        themselves indebted to powerful people, having been forced to take a marker on their
                                        ships just to stay in business. Such markers inevitably lead Smugglers into a kind
                                        of indentured servitude unless they can figure a way out of it. That requires a very
                                        big "score" of some kindâ€”a job of such financial reward, the Smuggler can buy his
                                        ship back and afford to operate on his own again.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Few Smugglers survive that kind of job. Most just deal with their circumstances
                                        and keep their ships going.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Even with a marker on the ship, though, Smugglers tend to have a great
                                        deal of autonomy, and they develop a great many skills and talents that any group
                                        making their way through the Outer Rim will find helpful. Smugglers know their way
                                        around the underworld and fringe society, and they tend to know how to get things
                                        done, especially if legality isn't an issue.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Smugglers are a vital part of Outer Rim society. With tariffs, quantity
                                        restrictions, and outright banning of even basic necessities being shipped to worlds
                                        not fully under Imperial Law, a great many people would be scratching out the poorest
                                        sort of existence, or perhaps dying outright due to lack of food and medicine. Smugglers'
                                        ships are the lifelines that keep many distant population centers going.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Of course, the most <i>profitable</i> cargoes are the ones that will land someone
                                        in the Kessel spice mines if he's caught with them.</p>
