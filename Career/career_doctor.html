                                <p class="card-text">Of all the types of Colonists who come to the Outer Rim, Doctors probably
                                        have the easiest time finding employment. They are in high demand almost anywhere
                                        they go. Unfortunately, most of what they are asked to do involves patching up the
                                        wounds of the worst kind of beings.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">With their skills, a Doctor brings not only healing and the treatment
                                        of illnesses with him, he brings a broad spectrum of knowledge and a solid persona
                                        in the face of adversity.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Most Doctors trade their healing talents for a chance to see more of
                                        the galaxy than their time in medical school ever allowed. Their overall motives
                                        can be as varied as those of any being, yet they tend to share a common instinct
                                        to heal where there is harm. While many will simply take up residence with whatever
                                        lord, corporation, or boss will hire them, other Doctors will find a way to get out
                                        into the larger galaxy, both to bring help to those in need and to experience life
                                        in some fashion.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">A Player Character Doctor is likely to be considered a kind of "combat
                                        medic" for the group; this isn't a bad thing at all, and the role will make him very
                                        popular. At the same time, a Doctor can often help with broader issues of understanding
                                        or finding things out, especially if there isn't a Scholar in the group.</p>

                                                a grizzled and bitter outlook. He could be especially frustrated because

                                                idealism and the desire to help others. Some are disturbed, quacks, or even
                                                amateur researchers who view their patients as little more than the subjects
                                                of their "experiments." Such an individual could have become a wanted man
                                                in many star systems, and decided to flee to a minor colony. There he could

                                                to survive, and use animals as means of transport and beasts of burden. Some
                                                colonists keep animals as faithful and useful companions. In these cases,
                                                a Doctor may have gotten his start as a veterinarian. Tending to the health
                                                of the animals in a community may have even led to practicing medicine on

                                                who themselves originate from the Outer Rim or other, equally far-flung locales.
                                                However, many of those Doctors who leave the remote edges of society to pursue

                                                problems they could not solve before. A Doctor might return to a colony to
                                                research a vaccine for a local disease that took a loved one long ago, help
