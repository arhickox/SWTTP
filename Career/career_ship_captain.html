                                <p class="card-text">For Ship Captains, their vessel and their crew are everything. Without
                                        them, captains are imprisoned in an incomplete existence. With both, they’re free.
                                        To protect this freedom, they demand an unmatched excellence from everyone aboard
                                        and provide the kind of leadership that gets these results. If crew members aren’t
                                        highly skilled when joining a crew, Ship Captains will push to them to become so
                                        through inspirational words and leading by example. In exchange, crew members become
                                        a family and gain access to a wealth of camaraderie, connections, and experience.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Ship Captains captain ships. It’s what they do and who they are. For
                                        most beings, investment in a vessel is an unfathomable dream. For Ship Captains,
                                        the lack of a vessel is an unbearable nightmare. Once they’ve tasted the freedom
                                        only a starship or wide-ranging skimmer can provide, it becomes impossible to return
                                        to a predictable life and a seemingly meaningless existence. Ship Captains control
                                        their own lives.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">In order to live their dreams, Ship Captains rely on the contributions
                                        of an effective and close-knit crew. While they can find jobs and know the best places
                                        to sell goods, they aren’t necessarily the finest of pilots, engineers, or fighters.
                                        When needed, they can always step in to fill a vacancy in order to escape pursuit,
                                        make a temporary fix, or shoot a blaster, but the best captains have specialists
                                        to fill these roles. Such specialists tend to travel with a single captain for extended
                                        durations. As captains and crews become comfortable with each other, all members
                                        learn how best to perform their key responsibilities and where they can most effectively
                                        support everyone else. For many, this professional arrangement acts as a surrogate
                                        family structure, with the captain as parent.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">As surrogate parents, Ship Captains are responsible for keeping everyone
                                        in line and for pushing them to be their best. When there is a dispute between crew
                                        members, captains resolve it. When a decision needs to be made, captains make it,
                                        and when shipmates doubt their own capabilities in a moment of crisis, captains instill
                                        them with confidence. Ship Captains themselves must be strong to earn the respect
                                        of their crews, but they cannot operate through strength and threats alone. If that
                                        strength can’t be tempered with compassion, every crew member will eventually find
                                        reasons to leave.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">This compassion is one reason why some captains rebel against the injustices
                                        of the Empire. For some of them, the Empire’s human-centric policies are intolerable,
                                        as they view species, beliefs, and affiliations as largely irrelevant as long as
                                        shipmates meld with the rest of the crew and perform well. Many others see the tightening
                                        grip of the Empire as a threat to their independent existence. This threat can be
                                        even more pronounced in light of a captain and crew’s past transgressions against
                                        the Empire.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Independent and driven to stay that way, Ship Captains are dangerous
                                        threats to the Empire. No matter what role, legal or otherwise, they may have had
                                        before they gained ownership and command of a vessel, they offer much to freedom
                                        fighters. With the capability to lead strikes with effectively supported crews, they
                                        give hope to and signal the possibility of a more powerful organized resistance.
                                        Wherever they are needed, Ship Captains can get there and inspire their crews to
                                        victory.
