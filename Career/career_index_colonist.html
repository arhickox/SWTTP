                <h1>Colonist Specializations</h1>

                <div class="card career-text-card">
                        <div class="card-body">
                                <p class="card-text">In a way, Colonists are the most out-of-place people in the Outer Rim.
                                        They are most often from the Core Worlds, where they were well educated and part
                                        of the cultural and professional elite. A Colonist doesn't tend to have the training
                                        to survive in areas of high conflict, and he isn't particularly adept at physical
                                        exploits.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">What he does possess, however, is a keen grasp of the bigger picture,
                                        and he usually has both the knowledge to understand probems and the capacity to get
                                        them solved. He probably came to the Outer Rim to create opportunities for himself,
                                        or to find a better life than what he left behind. If he cannot find that better
                                        life, he'll apply all of his knowledge to the task of creating it, and he'll use
                                        his considerable social skills to gather like-minded allies to his cause.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Of course, not all Colonists are necessarily altruistic in their pursuits.
                                        If knowledge is power, and power corrupts, then it follows that the Colonist is well-suited
                                        to take what he knows and exploit it for personal wealth. With charisma and street
                                        smarts, a Colonist might gather quite a team of specialists together to both watch
                                        his back and see to it that his enemies are brought to heel as he solidifies his
                                        power base. Countless Outer Rim worlds have become the personal fiefs of Colonists
                                        with bold ideas and willing followers.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Of course, some Colonists fail in their pursuits, and run afoul of the
                                        law or their fellows. These Colonists are forced to flee their lives of luxury and
                                        survive wherever they can. Some of these individuals may fall in with less reputable,
                                        even criminal, individuals. Luckily, these unfortunate Colonists sometimes find their
                                        unique skill sets are in high demand.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The clever Colonists—the ones most likely to survive their first few
                                        months in the Outer Rim—figure out how to parlay their knowledge and talents into
                                        currency and contacts. Providing excellent advice, medical aid, or valuable knowledge
                                        can easily endear a Colonist to a warlord or gang leader, giving him the very thing
                                        he needs most: security. From a position of relative safety, a wise Colonist will
                                        begin gathering connections and data, building up a network that he can one day exploit
                                        for his aims, whatever they may be.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Colonists are the consummate leaders, negotiators, inspirational speakers,
                                        and strategists. A Colonist can take any small group of capable operators and turn
                                        them into a true force to be reckoned with. A capable Colonist in a group can mean
                                        the difference between just getting by and doing something truly spectacular in the
                                        galaxy.</p>
