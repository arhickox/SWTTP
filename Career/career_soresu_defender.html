                                        order to aid others. However, just as the Protector is unmatched at keeping others
                                        safe, the Soresu Defender has mastered the art of self defense. With lightsaber in
                                        hand, Soresu Defenders can fend off hordes of enemies or stand firm against hails
                                        of blaster fire, surviving the worst the enemy can throw at them. With their combination
                                        of skills, the character can maintain constant vigilance, recognize threats, and
                                        remain resolute in the face of danger.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Soresu Defenders depend on the Force to guide them through dangers.
                                        Their techniques rest almost entirely on knowing how best to use their weapons for
                                        defensive purposes. In many ways, this style approaches the level of precognition,
                                        as the Force guides its practitioners to use their weapons to deflect an incoming
                                        attack or to move out of the way of an assault. Individuals who are unaware of their
                                        Force potential can become accomplished martial artists using these techniques, but
                                        true Soresu Defenders must be sensitive to the Force.</p>

                                                of its students in the signature defensive sword style of the Soresu Defender,
                                                was lost in the carnage of Order 66. Yet, in isolated parts of the galaxy,
                                                some traditions derived from the Soresu technique’s legacy have survived.
                                                The character might have been trained in a peacekeeping art whose forms and
                                                techniques are drawn from ancient forms of Soresu style. Alternately, the
                                                PC might have learned it under a swordmaster who trained with the Jedi long
                                                ago—or even fought against them. However this character came upon his signature
                                                technique, it is a cherished fragment of the past and represents a deep bond
                                                to the ancient Guardians of old.

                                                Defender might have attracted attention through willful efforts. Perhaps
                                                a combination of natural talent and hubris incited the Soresu Defender to
                                                wantonly challenge anyone with a sword. Then, one day, the character met
                                                a swordmaster with even greater skill—someone who instructed the PC the roots
                                                of Soresu technique. The character might have developed a sense of humility
                                                during this training, but anyone who leaps willingly into the fray to fight
                                                often maintains a flair for the dramatic.

                                                story. Perhaps a Soresu Defender appeared mysteriously to the syndicate one
                                                day, already trained, or maybe the character learned from a secretive mentor
                                                who possessed some shard of lost Jedi lore.

                                                teachings far and wide before their fall. A Soresu Defender might have stumbled
                                                upon a holocron containing records of Jedi training routines for lightsaber
                                                combat. With this bit of knowledge in hand, the character might have launched

                                                to find lost relics, forgotten sanctuaries. Above all, the character might
                                                seek rumors of Force-sensitive hermits who could help the developing Soresu
