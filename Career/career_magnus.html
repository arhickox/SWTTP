                                <p class="card-text">To hear of a Magus, even during the time of the Galactic Republic, would
                                        be a rare event; to meet one, even more so. The Jedi Order, in its waning days, had
                                        become quite conservative regarding explorations into the Force. The Jedi either
                                        avoided or outright fought the myriad of sects and cults exhibiting mystical powers
                                        throughout the galaxy. The Force, they reasoned, was all they needed. Other teachings
                                        and experiments deviated too much from the clear path of the Jedi and thus danced
                                        too close to illusion and self-deception, leading to temptations — toward the dark
                                        side of the Force.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Paradoxically, a Force user may be more likely to become a Magus during
                                        the Galactic Civil War. With hope and the light in short supply, some disciples may
                                        be more open and willing to seek out so-called forbidden knowledge. A Magus develops
                                        and collects a hodgepodge of strange rituals and odd practices to commune with the
                                        Cosmic Force. They have no training, but at the same time, they have no teachings
                                        that would convince them not to try. The danger, of course, comes from a lack of
                                        oversight. Without a guiding hand or proper self-reflection, a Magus has a greater
                                        chance to experiment with powers fueled by the dark side of the Force.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Knowledge, especially forbidden knowledge, fuels the Magus. Unrestricted
                                        by the Jedi Order, defiant of the Galactic Empire, the Magus seeks a connection to
                                        the Force through knowledge. The source of that knowledge doesn’t matter; rituals,
                                        objects and places of power, and ancient religious and magical texts all hint at
                                        a singular source of energy. While some Magi crave knowledge for its own sake, most
                                        explore the Magus path in order to control the Force itself.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">If the Force flows through everything and is a part of everything, then
                                        by manipulating the Force, the Magus can manipulate reality. The Force can be used
                                        to make matter, affect matter, affect life, and perhaps...even create life. With
                                        this power, the Magus can do amazing and impossible things. No, not impossible, for
                                        nothing is impossible if one believes in the Force.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">This confidence, however, is the biggest trap for Magi. They can do
                                        impossible things, yes, but it is the Force that allows them to do so, not their
                                        knowledge or talent. Despite what they may think, Magi still have mortal trappings.
                                        They have histories, memories, early thoughts, and emotions that can never be truly
                                        removed. Hubris may be the greatest enemy for Magi. This hubris can trick Magi into
                                        thinking that pushing here or pulling there might be for the good of all, or for
                                        the good of the Force, but in reality, they are manipulating the Force for their
                                        own selfish needs. Many a Force-using tyrant became a Magus before falling to the
                                        dark side.

                                                also integrated their own bodies into the art. The suffering they inflicted

                                                mad. They would act with no discernible pattern. One day, they plastered
                                                posters with images or phrases that caught a pedestrian’s imagination. On
                                                another day, they sent messages through the HoloNet to warn officials of
                                                incoming dangers. On still another day, these augurs shouted out warnings
                                                on the street corner to change the mood of a crowd. Magus augurs may appear
                                                not to act with a goal; however in actuality they can see the flow of the
                                                Force and do its will—whatever that will may be.

                                                be skeptics. Educating themselves in the techniques of stage magic, they
                                                spotted shell games, sleights of hand, body readings, and a variety of other
                                                tricks. Often abrasive, they spent a lot of time critiquing religious doctrines,
                                                busting cults, and exposing scams. When these skeptics discovered an ancient
                                                ritual from an outdated religion called the Force, they enthusiastically
                                                tried to debunk it and failed. This drove them to dig deeper and find more
                                                secrets, until they became devout Magi.

                                                They spent their time sifting between their needs and desires, isolating

                                                also experiment, modify, and apply new rites. Political experts of this background
                                                experimented like social scientists. They took a political system and subtly

                                                using strange rituals and techniques to bring themselves to a higher state
                                                of consciousness. At first, they needed something to shock them out of their
                                                physical comfort, using fasting, icy cold or hot and sweaty immersions, and
                                                the like. Some pushed further, scouring their bodies in order to bolster
