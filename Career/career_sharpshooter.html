                                <p class="card-text">With a love of firearms and a pride in personal accuracy, the Sharpshooter
                                        is the most desirable asset a team can ask for when a firefight erupts. He maintains
                                        his composure under a blanket of blaster bolts, takes careful aim, and eliminates
                                        threats with ruthless efficiency and lightning speed. Sharpshooters are, simply,
                                        the masters of personal-scale ranged combat.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The focus on personal-scale ranged weapons is a natural fit for Sharpshooters,
                                        and their ability to take in their surroundings completely and assess targets carefully
                                        under high-stress situations is essential to their survival.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Most Sharpshooters are thoroughly comfortable with any ranged weapon,
                                        though many will focus attention and effort on mastering a single (often highly-personalized)
                                        weapon. Some prefer a sniper role, taking up a hidden position and removing threats
                                        from the field as invisible dealers of death. Other Sharpshooters prefer a more direct
                                        approach, blaster energy blazing in waves of destruction as they cover their teammates
                                        against hordes of Imperial soldiers.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The focus on individual excellence within the Alliance elevates the
                                        Sharpshooter over his typical counterpart in the Empire. He is encouraged to train
                                        to higher degrees of proficiency, and he is encouraged to master techniques of survival,
                                        depending on his team to stay alive. The average stormtrooper is given a decent amount
                                        of training, but the lack of attention to personal excellence means he will never
                                        reach the pinnacle of accuracy and deadly effectiveness attained by a Sharpshooter
                                        in the Rebellion.</p>

                                                military personnel at long range, the Empire occasionally calls on them to

                                                civilians. Some find themselves sympathizing with their targets and end up

                                                far too few snipers with formal training, and often provide trained shooters
                                                additional objectives on missions in the form of assassinations and reconnaissance
                                                operations. Rebels also rely on mercenary snipers to train promising recruits,
