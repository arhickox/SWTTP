                                <p class="card-text">Marauders don't necessarily mind shooting their opponents, but they
                                        would much rather get mixed up in a melee, weapons in hand, smashing and slashing
                                        their way through. Marauders are tough—probably the toughest combatants in any conflict.
                                        They tend to take a great deal of punishment while dealing out far more to any who
                                        dare go against them.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Marauders make excellent "leg-breakers," among other things, and they
                                        usually know quite a bit about how to survive in most situations. In combat, they
                                        are masters of dishing out and taking lots of damage.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Marauders may come from low-tech worlds, where advanced weaponry simply
                                        wasn't an option for them. Alternately, they might come from a culture where melee
                                        combat is considered far more honorable and worthy, and they keep to their traditions.
                                        Moreover, many pirates and raiders of starships favor melee weapons in order to avoid
                                        damaging vital systems aboard a ship they're in the middle of trying to take.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">A character who chooses to be a Marauder might be an ex-pirate. Alternatively,
                                        he could be in the adventure to make money in the only way he can—with his fists.
                                        It could be that he's simply along for the ride, ready to bash his way through whatever
                                        adventure he encounters.</p>

                                                An arena fighter known and lauded for his combat ability might grow older,

                                                For example, the character might prefer fighting with his bare fists instead
                                                of any number of more advanced weapons, or he might avoid killing his opponents
                                                in favor of incapacitation. A competitive attitude could lead him to start
