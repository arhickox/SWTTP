                                <p class="card-text">Seekers often focus on survival in hostile settings where they must
                                        rely solely on their own abilities. Such selfreliance can also be reflected in their
                                        combat abilities, as each shot or strike must end a battle as swiftly as possible.
                                        Merely wounding or dissuading a foe is not sufficient in these cases, as often only
                                        one party can leave the encounter alive. Executioners embody this focus on precise
                                        lethality. Many become feared across systems for their effective means of eliminating
                                        any threat that requires removal. Determining which threats deserve their deadly
                                        and personal attention, though, can make for complex judgement calls. Such decisions
                                        and the methods by which they render them can also lead Executioners down the path
                                        to the dark side.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Executioners are perhaps the embodiment of the Seeker career as apex
                                        predator, and they excel at the art of death. While other careers and specializations
                                        can produce effective fighters, Executioners are more concerned with maximizing the
                                        damage they inflict to ensure a quick, definitive end to their conflicts. Given their
                                        emerging connection to the Force, there are few who can match these lethal characters’
                                        ability to achieve this goal.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Others might view Executioners as brutal killers, but this is a simplistic
                                        view. Killing is often the outcome of combat, but Executioners might attempt to avoid
                                        conflict altogether, as their aim is only for a fatal end for their target. This
                                        could even mean a target is eliminated by long-range fire or a decisive lightsaber
                                        strike before even becoming aware of any danger. When eliminating one saves hundreds
                                        of others or frees entire villages from suffering, many Executioners see their work
                                        as perhaps distasteful, but certainly necessary.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Executioners are not always grim, dispassionate assassins, though many
                                        are driven by intellect rather than emotion. Some may can view their calling as a
                                        righteous one, celebrating each threat they remove before it can harm others. Others
                                        might see each lethal act as a step toward redemption for past sins. Inflicting death
                                        should never be an easy act, k however. Those who trivialize it or become too emotionally
                                        attached to their goals are at risk of becoming enthralled by the dark side of the
                                        Force—which some Executioners might not realize until far too late.</p>

                                                one of two reasons: having killed targets whom others did not wish to see
                                                die, or in pursuit of targets whom they cannot tolerate to live. In the former
                                                case, Executioners might have fled retribution or the reach of the law, or
                                                they might have quietly left before their handiwork came to light. In the
                                                latter instance, their targets could be anyone from an elusive personal nemesis
                                                to a threat to the home they left behind.</li>

                                                to goal so much as from target to target. As stories of the latest Imperial

                                                might make others uneasy, but the nature of such work means Executioners
                                                are rarely in one place long enough for matters to come to a head—except

                                                life is cheap. The Force may be present in all living beings, but if they
                                                cannot defend themselves against the dangers around them, they won’t be living
                                                beings for long. The harshness of these environments usually means living
                                                by a simple code: kill or be killed. Seekers born to such a life often become
                                                Executioners, adapting their prowess with the Force to the lifestyle their
                                                upbringing taught them. They might use their skills to protect others, trying
                                                to end the need for their continued intervention by slaying once and for
                                                all the threats drove them to take up their path. However, such altruism
                                                might not come easily to them; they could settle for simply being the deadliest
                                                being around, daring anyone else to challenge them.</li>

                                                reactions to life-and-death struggles. Some hide, some flee, and some confront
                                                the threat head-on. Seekers who become accustomed to treading the last of
                                                these paths sometimes take a more proactive approach as Executioners, adopting
                                                a killor- be-ki I led attitude toward the threats that come their way. These
                                                Seekers must be careful not to misjudge a threat, or they risk falling to

                                                patience for the aftermath. They may travel the galaxy in hopes of evading
