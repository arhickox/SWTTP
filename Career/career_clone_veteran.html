                                        pale in comparison to field experience. Even the engineers on Kamino and the skeptics in the Republic
                                        government can’t deny the skill and talent of a veteran
                                        soldier. A training program can’t take into account all
                                        the variables of combat, so veterans rely on firsthand
                                        knowledge of battle, tactics, and even psychology.
                                        Engagement with the enemy means learning about
                                        the enemy, and a clone commander or Jedi is wise to
                                        ask the counsel of a veteran on any tactical matter.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Thanks to their accelerated training program and
                                        genetic design, clones have an amazing flexibility to
                                        learn on the field. Veterans have fought
                                        in enough urban environments and infiltrated enough
                                        bases to know the ins and outs of security systems.
                                        Further, they have been thrown into so many different
                                        environments that they have prepared some basic survival tactics for all biomes.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Veterans aren’t necessarily officers. The upper
                                        echelons of the military quickly realized field experience among the basic troopers aided in survivability,
                                        morale, and further training, so the bureaucracy does
                                        its best to seed veterans among green squads. For a civilian, this decision seems unfair; some of the most
                                        experienced and decorated veterans hold a low rank
                                        compared to their commanders in order to avoid
                                        breaking the chain of command. Most veterans hold
                                        no grudge or resentment, since some don’t have the
                                        aptitude or attitude for leadership. They would rather
                                        utilize their skills and knowledge directly on the field
                                        alongside their brothers. Veterans have many ways to
                                        serve the Grand Army and the Republic.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Because of their experience, veterans display a wide
                                        range of individualistic behaviors. For example, on one
                                        end of the spectrum, some become hardened, by-the-code career soldiers. Gruff and cynical yet dedicated,
                                        these veterans see new, fresh troopers as temporary
                                        annoyances. They perform their duty to keep them in
                                        line and to teach them how to survive. Veterans won’t
                                        give the shinies they instruct any respect, though—they
                                        must earn it like any trooper. On the other end of the
                                        spectrum, some veterans end up with odd quirks and
                                        affectations above and beyond the usual clone trooper habits. They adopt a local herb for their medpac,
                                        wear a feather from a local bird for each kill, adopt the
                                        practices of a local warrior culture, and so on. Veterans
                                        know they are different than the other troopers and
                                        express this self-awareness in different ways.
                                        </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Command simply shrugs its shoulders when witnessing these idiosyncrasies. Veterans remain dedicated to
                                        the Republic and their brothers, and the military needs
                                        their experience and skill. In many ways, veterans have
                                        more reason than others to be loyal to the Grand Army.
                                        They have lived long enough as a soldier and have no
                                        reason to turn back now. Some Senators have spoken
                                        on the subject of reinstating some historical medals
                                        and rewards to recognize the bravery of these veterans.
                                        In an ironic turn, plenty of veterans see this as a meaningless gesture, an award more for a Senator’s public
                                        relations opportunity than as an acknowledgement of
                                        the sacrifices made for the good of the Republic.</p>

                                                distinct identities. Unique acts of heroism, unusual interests, or novel insights and discoveries all
                                                offer ways to set a particular clone apart from his

                                                the temptation to turn away from their duty. They
                                                might face overwhelming odds, encounter a generous bribe, or even have to turn their back on a
