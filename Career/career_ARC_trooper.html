                                <p class="card-text">While the bulk of the Grand Army of the Republic
                                        consists of the standard clone troopers, military leadership and the engineers of Kamino recognized the
                                        need for specialized soldiers. Squads of Advanced
                                        Recon Commando troopers fulfill the need for small
                                        and flexible tactical squads to take on unconventional objectives despite ever-changing and unknown
                                        situations and lack of access to command leadership.
                                        These elite soldiers act independently and creatively,
                                        showcasing the clones’ potential in a way that can
                                        only be called human.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">ARC Troopers have to
                                        be in peak physical condition to survive the many different climates and planets of the galaxy. They are
                                        often selected for daring aerial insertions and other
                                        missions requiring jetpacks. The abilities not only to
                                        operate jetpacks and other specialized gear but also
                                        to keep them in working order on the field can be
                                        crucial. Often, ARC Troopers must get behind enemy
                                        lines and back out again without being detected.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Both command and the clones consider ARC
                                        Troopers to be the best of the best, and clones with
                                        ambition aim to get promoted into the program. They
                                        receive additional training, including a direct contradiction to their original directive: they are required
                                        to think creatively and independently. Unsurprisingly, many clones fail this training, but it is a badge of
                                        honor to be selected in the first place. While these
                                        troopers receive additional benefits such as increased
                                        rations, better equipment, and—supposedly—more
                                        recreation time, they generally only live for the admiration and praise of their peers and the satisfaction of
                                        a job well done.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">ARC Troopers push themselves above and beyond,
                                        sacrificing their safety and lives to ensure successful
                                        missions. They tend to have less downtime, despite the
                                        promise of more recreation periods. The ever-changing
                                        nature ofthe Clone Wars means constant reassignment. This results in a heavy demand for more ARC Troopers,
                                        so both command and the engineers on Kamino seek
                                        to identify soldiers with potential.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Though ARC Troopers often hold higher ranks—all
                                        the way up to commander—they do not always command the rank and file troops. ARC Troopers are as
                                        likely to perform duties independently of the main
                                        contingent of soldiers, and an ARC Trooper’s position
                                        in the command structure may change based on the
                                        mission at hand. The rank and file don’t always interpret an ARC Trooper’s unconventional orders well,
                                        and ARC Troopers tend to chafe against making safe
                                        but conservative tactical decisions.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">ARC Troopers receive a lot of leeway while on special assignment. Often operating independently and
                                        without direct oversight, they make decisions balancing the successful completion of their mission, the
                                        survival of their brothers, and the defense of innocent
                                        civilians. As a result, CAR leadership, and sometimes
                                        Kamino engineers, hold intense debriefing sessions in
                                        order to ascertain whether this independence poses
                                        a threat to the Republic. In each instance, the ARC
                                        Troopers prove to be loyal, self-sacrificing, and of the
                                        highest moral character.</p>

                                                distinct identities. Unique acts of heroism, unusual interests, or novel insights and discoveries all
                                                offer ways to set a particular clone apart from his

                                                throughout their careers, Clone Soldiers may face
                                                the temptation to turn away from their duty. They
                                                might face overwhelming odds, encounter a generous bribe, or even have to turn their back on a

                                                their sacrifice may be necessary to secure a victory for the Republic. These soldiers are willing to

                                                try to take it further: to be the first to the objective, destroy the most droids in a skirmish, or
