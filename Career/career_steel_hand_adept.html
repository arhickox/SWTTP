                                <p class="card-text">The Jedi were known for, and even symbolized by, their distinctive use
                                        of lightsabers. For those who also know of the Sith and their own use of lightsabers,
                                        it would seem that these weapons are a universal feature of Force users. This was
                                        never truly the case, especially not in this age of the Empire, when most Force sensitives
                                        must do without formal training in any Force tradition. Through necessity or choice,
                                        Force users do battle with a variety of weapons, from vibro-axes to repeating blasters.
                                        And some fight with no weapons at all. These skills allow Adepts to fight with their
                                        mind and body in perfect harmony, and with mastery over both.

                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Countless martial arts disciplines have focused on unarmed combat through
                                        the millennia, from Teräs Käsi to Zavat. Even the most renowned masters of hand-to-hand
                                        combat face certain limitations when compared to wielders of the variety of advanced
                                        weapons in use throughout the galaxy. No fist or claw can breach heavy armor, or
                                        overcome the range advantage of a blaster—none, that is, except those of beings who
                                        wield the Force like a weapon.

                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Steel Hand Adepts might represent Force users with training in a variety
                                        of martial arts forms. Some might specialize in a particular form, while others might
                                        blend techniques from many practices. Alternatively, an Adept could be self-taught,
                                        augmenting an improvisational combat style honed through years of cantina brawls
                                        with an instinctive use of the Force. Regardless of their background, Steel Hand
                                        Adepts draw on the Force to accomplish seemingly impossible maneuvers, from punching
                                        through heavy combat armor to striking enemies beyond arms’ reach.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">The ways of Steel Hand Adepts have little basis in the teachings of
                                        the Jedi Order. Although the Jedi trained in some hand-to-hand techniques, these
                                        were generally used as a recourse should a Knight be disarmed or ambushed without
                                        a lightsaber at hand. However, many other Force disciplines have come and gone throughout
                                        the galaxy’s history, and some of these have focused more prominently on unarmed
                                        combat. Conversely, many martial arts traditions have a strong mystical component,
                                        tapping into the Force in varying capacities. Although martial arts schools of this
                                        kind generally accept members who are not particularly Force-sensitive, those who
                                        are so gifted tend to excel, becoming masters and legends.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">The capabilities of Steel Hand Adepts can be astounding for onlookers
                                        and terrifying for foes. Not only can adepts exhibit the same range of abilities
                                        other Force users draw upon to augment their lightsaber strikes, but they can fight
                                        just as effectively without a weapon of any kind. A practiced Adept can even be a
                                        match for an accomplished lightsaber duelist. Against more ordinary combatants, they
                                        spin and leap with frightening grace, laying foes low with rapid strikes.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">A Steel Hand Adept can easily disarm all but the most skilled opponents
                                        through a variety of techniques. Some adepts can even shatter weapons with their
                                        bare hands. An unarmed opponent of an Adept, far from being on equal footing, is
                                        almost certainly at an insurmountable disadvantage. Enemies with the seeming advantage
                                        of range are not safe, either. Blaster-wielding foes are often surprised when a Force
                                        user affects objects and even sentients at a distance, but no Force ability is as
                                        shocking as Adepts’ ability to lash out with punishing strikes, laying into foes
                                        at range with the full strength and impact of their fists and feet.

                                                arises. The Steel Hand Adept has developed careful control of their body
                                                and mind, but this need for control may stem from a point in the past when
                                                control was lost and their need for vengeance overrode all else. Although
                                                this character seeks vengeance, it is with a mind unclouded by the emotion
                                                that can affect other Warriors on this path.

                                                is never as helpless as they might seem. At meetings and gatherings where
