                                        the Drivers that move beings around once they hit dirtside. While nearly anyone can
                                        manage the basics of a ground vehicle or a speeder, a Driver is priceless when the
                                        blaster bolts start flying or the weather turns particularly nasty. It's one thing
                                        to know how to go forward and back and how to apply the breaks. It's another thing
                                        entirely to know how far one can flip a speeder over to one side without stalling
                                        while skirting the wall of a canyon, swerving through rocky outcroppings and avoiding
                                        a hail of plasma fire from the swoop gang that's chasing the group.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Drivers understand the machines they operate, and they are exceptionally
                                        skilled with nearly anything that moves from one place on a planet to another, typically
                                        demonstrating some higher level of style or finesse.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Drivers are highly valued almost anywhere they go. Companies, military
                                        and security units, governments, and criminal factions all have a regular need for
                                        those who can transport personnel and goods over a planet's surface. Additionally,
                                        more than a few planets in the Outer Rim have traditions of racing of one style or
                                        another, and Drivers are naturals for being able to enter such competitions and walk
                                        away with a decent purse. Naturally, this depends on their skill and their ability
                                        to avoid being killed by other Drivers.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">An Explorer with a Driver specialization is a natural fit for almost
                                        any Player Character group. His basic skill set as an Explorer is already helpful,
                                        and his talents for moving the group around on a planet automatically make him exceedingly
                                        valuable. This is especially true when the inevitable situation arises demanding
                                        a quick getaway under a hail of blaster fire.</p>

                                                from an academic background, but it's not impossible to come up with a story
                                                that makes sense. For example, imagine a scientist who designs the latest
                                                power systems and insists on testing them himself in the harshest held conditions.
                                                Perhaps his ideas are too radical, and he needs a team to help him take a
                                                prototype to the Outer Rim to truly prove the concept, far away from the
                                                prying eyes of Imperial watchdogs.</li>

                                                need to get away quickly and cleanly. Out in the frontier areas, many Drivers
                                                discover that legitimate jobs are few and far between (and often boring),
                                                while the truly lucrative opportunities to employ their gifts come with working
                                                for those on the wrong side of the law. What's more, the very idea of speed
                                                limits and traffic regulations is anathema to a Driver, so he is likely to
                                                have a number of traffic violations on his record wherever he goes.</li>

                                                high demand throughout the galaxy, so many of them specifically go into business
                                                for themselves as professionals. Many prefer to maintain a distance from
                                                their clients; they only want to know what they are driving, where they are
                                                going, and how they are getting paid. Others will contract on a long-term
                                                basis with a client, usually with a stronger idea of who and what they are
                                                transporting. Of course, combat-oriented Drivers can usually make decent

                                                in the Empire, operating every form of vehicle imaginable. Speeders, ground
                                                rovers, walkers, swoopsâ€”all these and more are part of the Imperial war machine,
                                                not to mention normal day-to-day business operations. As with all Imperial
                                                institutions, there are strictures, policies, and regulations for everything,
                                                which can be painfully inhibiting to someone who truly wishes to let loose
                                                and push his vehicle beyond its alleged limits. Unfortunately, skilled technicians
                                                in any role tend to be greatly valued by the Empire, especially if they know
                                                a great deal about high-end machinery that shouldn't be shared with the galaxy
                                                at large. Such a Driver may well find his way as far out into the frontier
                                                as possible, where he can find an old classic of a speeder, enhance its performance,
                                                and show the rustics what a great machine with a great Driver can really
                                                do.

                                                and a fascination with machines. As with the Big-Came Hunter, a noble may
                                                decide that he derives a sense of power over his environment by mastering
                                                machines of motion. Winning races in a Podracer or on a swoop has that element
                                                of danger that truly appeals to those who have everything. When one loses
