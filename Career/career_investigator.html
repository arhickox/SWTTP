                                <p class="card-text">Investigators examine unsolved crimes, using their knowledge and skills
                                        to figure out the who, what, when, where, and why. They don’t seek this information
                                        merely to satisfy some obsession over the ugly side of society but rather to honor
                                        the victims by bringing the perpetrators to justice.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Investigators piece together what has been lost or stolen by uncovering
                                        the past. Weaving the stories of what happened into a living chronicle, they discover
                                        secrets and untan gle lies. Only by understanding the how and why of a crime can
                                        Investigators bring the one who did it to justice.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Since crimes are inflicted upon (and inflicted by) people, these acts
                                        leave an impression in the Force. Particularly violent crimes leave a strong disturbance.
                                        Extremely evil crimes leave a wound—a cold, dark space that frightens the unwary
                                        and consumes the foolhardy. Investigators can tease out details from those impressions,
                                        unwinding them so they can heal. In many ways, Investigators are physicians for the
                                        souls of communities, solving festering mysteries, airing out toxic secrets, and
                                        cauterizing hidden crimes.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">These violent impressions can also affect individuals. Even if they
                                        haven’t witnessed the crime in question, investigators have heard rumors, have felt
                                        their community suffer, and can read their peers with the insight of an insider.
                                        In many ways, a community functions as a single, living organism, and damage to that
                                        organism reverberates in both predictable and surprising ways. By tracing those symptoms,
                                        Investigators get to the source.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Investigators have many tools in their kits besides the Force. Understanding
                                        the local customs and language, being familiar with the unspoken rules of a community,
                                        and knowing how to bluff their way into a back room requires knowledge and social
                                        skills. Slicing a security camera, picking a lock to search an apartment, or staking
                                        out a person of interest in an investigation means breaking laws without getting
                                        caught. And sometimes—oftentimes—successfully sneaking into and out of a building
                                        can bring the Investigator one step closer to the truth.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The greatest tools of Investigators, though, can often become their
                                        greatest weaknesses. Their emotions can help them understand a person’s motives,
                                        giving context to a fact. If a perpetrator killed a dangerous drug lord, is that
                                        person a murderer or a savior? However, emotions can cloud an investigator’s judgment.
                                        If the good friend who saved a life turns out to be a slaver, is it a betrayal to
                                        turn that friend in? Finally, the constant exposure to suffering can burn out even
                                        the most stalwart of Investigators.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">In the final analysis, Investigators see crime and victimization as
                                        a corruption of the Force. They feel the Force as something that flows through people,
                                        affecting their health, psychology, and well-being. A corruption of the Force makes
                                        people angrier, more fearful, and more likely to lash out and harm others. These
                                        constant cuts caused by crime chip away at a society, wounding the Force until the
                                        whole society falls to the dark side. Airing out the source of the wound allows the
                                        society to finally heal.</p>

                                                in their elite peers throughout the galaxy. What starts as a sudden insight
                                                inevitably branches into probing questions about the systems that gave them
                                                their titles in the first place. Just as they first examined their families,

                                                of the aristocracy was taken, not built. Their inability to keep silent about
                                                these truths and injustices means these characters can never return to a

                                                to the ground can gather more data than one, and those two dozen can quickly
                                                sift and analyze that information for truth, lies, and idle rumors. Investigators

                                                communal building, these laborers start asking questions and don’t stop.
                                                The questions, of course, lead to more questions, but they also lead to enemies—
                                                enemies of the workers, or worse. These Investigators form personal connections
                                                while stitching together broken communities, perhaps even establishing dialogue
                                                between different factions. When they find the culprit, they often find that
                                                the crime is a symptom of a larger societal disease, leading them to look

                                                to a corporate oversight committee. Their time spent investigating upward,
                                                grinding against the leadership structure, gives them an excellent command
                                                of bureaucracy, despite all its hurdles. Whereas other officials may burn
