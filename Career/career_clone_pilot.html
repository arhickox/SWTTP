                                <p class="card-text">Interplanetary conflict inevitably brings battles to
                                        the upper atmosphere and the void of space. Capital ships play a prominent role in these battles, but
                                        large wings of starfighters are a vital part of every
                                        conflict. These specialized ships exploit their smaller
                                        profile and variations in armament to avoid detection
                                        while occupying a variety of roles. Military transports
                                        deploy from capital ships—often through active war
                                        zones in the company of starfighter screens—to deliver troops and equipment to a planet’s surface, where
                                        clones can engage the enemy.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Every Clone Soldier has the rudimentary knowledge required to pilot repulsorlift vehicles, walkers,
                                        and starfighters. However, basic skills alone are
                                        inadequate for success in a combat environment. To
                                        address this, some Clone Soldiers receive additional
                                        training in the Clone Pilot specialization and are
                                        inducted into the Republic Navy branch of the Grand
                                        Army of the Republic.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">A degree of familiarity with these skills is
                                        vital for any Clone Soldier to survive as a starfighter
                                        pilot. While any battlefield is profoundly dangerous,
                                        the vacuum of space adds significant risks that are
                                        not present during typical planetary conflicts. Additional training mitigates some of those dangers but
                                        can never completely eliminate them.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Clone Pilots serve as members of a squadron
                                        under the command of a Clone Officer, who has also
                                        mastered the skills of a pilot. A squadron is typically assigned a particular type of craft, although this
                                        can change based on mission requirements. Clone
                                        Pilots are sometimes reassigned to other squadrons
                                        in which they are expected to fly other craft. Consequently, their training includes exposure to a range of
                                        starfighters, speeders, and walkers.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Typical starfighter assignments include the Republic Z-95 Headhunter starfighter, the V-19 Torrent
                                        starfighter, and the ARC-170 starfighter. Those Clone
                                        Pilots assigned to transport duty typically fly Low
                                        Altitude Assault Transports (LAATs) or A/tz-class attack
                                        shuttles. Collectively, these spacecraft represent the
                                        core of the Republic Navy’s smaller craft.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Some Clone Pilots are assigned to operate vehicles that work more closely with ground units. These
                                        include AT-RT and AT-TE walkers, and BARC speeders,
                                        among others. Notably, these craft are not normally
                                        under the oversight of the Republic Navy branch of
                                        the GAR. As such, Clone Pilots assigned to them do
                                        not fall under the oversight of the naval chain of command, leaving them far less likely to pilot starfighters.</p>

                                                distinct identities. Unique acts of heroism, unusual interests, or novel insights and discoveries all

                                                their sacrifice may be necessary to secure a victory for the Republic. These soldiers are willing to

                                                try to take it further: to be the first to the objective, destroy the most droids in a skirmish, or
