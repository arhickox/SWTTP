                                        hether they wield the power of the Force consciously or not, Wardens know that they have been gifted with power. But more
                                        importantly, they know that they must wield this might to perform a necessary duty,
                                        subduing those who would abuse that same power to harm the Warden’s friends and allies.
                                        While Guardians of all stripes might be driven by a desire to create a fairer world,
                                        the concept of justice is especially important to Wardens. The job of punishing the
                                        wicked is frequently a thankless one, especially in the era of the Empire, when the
                                        ruling regime is so deeply corrupt. Many Wardens see this burden as inevitable; after
                                        all, it is their role to make sure that evil is stripped of the means to threaten
                                        their chosen allies, not to be loved for these efforts.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Warden is unique among Guardian specializations in being focused
                                        specifically on weakening enemies rather than just bolstering allies. In some ways,
                                        this specialization is the mirror image of the Aggressor. Both wield fear as a weapon,
                                        but the Warden uses dread to weaken foes’ strikes rather than make them more vulnerable
                                        to attacks, and relies on counterattacking instead of striking first. What a Warden
                                        lacks in raw toughness as compared to a Protector or Armorer, this unique Guardian
                                        makes up for with the ability to control foes options by restricting their movement,
                                        inflicting strain upon them, and intimidating them into submission.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Wardens are suited to taking major roles on and off the battlefield,
                                        thanks to their specialization’s focus on Coercion. While using intimidation as a
                                        primary social tool can have consequences for a character’s Morality, many unnecessary
                                        fights can be avoided if potential foes are too afraid to draw their weapons against
                                        a Warden. In battle, Wardens shine in close quarters, where foes must approach to
                                        attack and thus suffer the consequences of engaging such frightening enemies. Wardens
                                        do what is needed to give their allies the best chance of survival in a harsh galaxy,
                                        and if this includes some unsavory tasks, so be it.

                                                a Warden is often the manifestation of a code of conduct—not just its prime
                                                enforcer, but also a living testament to its power. If a Warden is an inheritor
                                                of a set of laws, the character might feel the need to apply them to the
                                                whole galaxy, dispensing justice upon any who violate the code. Of course,
                                                such a character can easily cross the line separating a protector of peace
                                                and order from a figure of dread and oppression. Those Wardens who wield
                                                their own absolute view of the law as a weapon are often drawn to the power
                                                of the dark side, and must ever be vigilant about slipping into tyranny.

                                                naval conflicts that decide the fate of star systems to skirmishes between
                                                cartels and criminal syndicates over individual neighborhoods. A Warden might
                                                have been a leadership figure in a gang or criminal syndicate, the sort of
                                                dangerous figure whom others follow out of a mix of admiration and fear.
                                                A character with this background might need to learn to live as part of civil
                                                society or might turn these skills to an insurgency against the Empire.

                                                or an enforcer charged with a similar set of tasks. In the name of earning
                                                a living, the character may have captured a veritable rogue’s gallery of
                                                outlaws, insurgents, and enemy leaders. Naturally, crime bosses often want
                                                targets taken alive in order to send a message, so the character might have
                                                developed experience with methods of non-lethal capture. The character might
                                                have adhered closely to the bounty hunter’s code in pursuits, or might have
                                                operated outside of the accepted rules of the chase—and made enemies because

                                                is well-suited to that task. The character may have discovered an emergent
                                                sensitivity to the Force in the fear others display around the Warden, or
                                                through an extremely sharp ability to discern lies. A character of this sort
                                                kept the company of rough-and-tumble allies, and might be very suspicious
                                                of others, even after leaving that life behind. The Warden might need to
