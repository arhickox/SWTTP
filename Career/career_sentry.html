                                <p class="card-text">Despite the grand legends of the Jedi and their sweeping battles in
                                        half-forgotten wars, neighborhoods still needed day-to-day protection. Padawans may
                                        have dreamt of striking down an evil general or forging alliances between powerful
                                        armies, but when they became Sentries, they patrolled the streets, city blocks, and
                                        alleyways to help the overlooked, the common people. These foot soldiers gained none
                                        of the glory of their peers, and their thankless tasks have not been preserved in
                                        Jedi myths, but their work has benefited countless lives throughout the years.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Although both have a lightsaber-focused specialization, Sentries and
                                        Shien Experts differ considerably. Whereas Shien Experts approach life and combat
                                        as tactical exercises, Sentries concentrate on the immediate and the personal. They
                                        reach their targets through speed or subterfuge, stay aware of potential threats,
                                        and strike sure and quick.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Sentries are concerned with the present: a crime committed is a violation
                                        too far and stopped too late. While other Sentinels concern themselves on the bigger
                                        picture, Sentries pick up the pieces in the moment. They catch those who slip through
                                        the cracks and are forgotten, and stop those who break through safeguards to do irreparable
                                        damage. To Sentries, the details are the real picture, and allowing one person to
                                        suffer in order to promote justice is no justice at all.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Perhaps the most personally engaged of the Sentinel specialists, Sentries
                                        defend individuals, whether a specific person they are charged with protecting or
                                        a random person walking down the street. During the days of the Jedi Order, Sentries
                                        were accused of being too attached to the singular, becoming too emotionally involved
                                        with people and losing sight of larger tasks. However, the Sentries remained steadfast,
                                        channeling grief, anger, and love into pushing themselves to their limits to save
                                        their charges, and finding strength in their personal attachments.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Despite their efforts—or perhaps because of them— Sentries don’t have
                                        a glowing reputation for purity. They revel in their reputation, utilizing fear and
                                        surprise against their opponents. Sentries can only maintain this reputation among
                                        their adversaries if their communities fear them as well. They must become the monster
                                        who the monsters fear.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Force guides Sentries to be in the right place at the right time
                                        to prevent violence. They move unseen, sometimes on rooftops to get a higher perspective,
                                        sometimes in the shadows to get an up-close point of view. Their senses expand as
                                        Sentries search for an opportunity, an opening to get the jump on evil.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Once engaged in combat, their priorities change. After slipping out
                                        of the shadows or dropping down from above, Sentries operate visibly and encourage
                                        their enemies to target them. Sentries want to be the most intimidating and to be
                                        the most dangerous-looking so that their enemies will fear them and fight them rather
                                        than their charges. Their talents lie not in ending a fight quickly or attacking
                                        directly, though; Sentries work best when surprising opponents, removing them one
                                        by one and giving the rest a chance to run away or surrender. In this way, This lets
                                        Sentries use the negative emotions of fear and anger to disorient their opponents.</p>

                                                precious time to continue vital work undisturbed. Often the strength behind

                                                movement. Many start off as a bodyguard for major political figures, but
                                                some serve as faceless muscle. In either case, the Sentry remains out of

                                                of this type struggles to understand what the oppressed need; still, the

                                                of ethics, sometimes acting as police or working with the police (at least
                                                with trustworthy members]. Gangs often end up sharing similarities with their
                                                leaders. Most Sentry-led gangs operate on the principle of might for right,
                                                but some gangs take on community service work. If the Sentry is particularly
                                                spiritual, the gang may end up sharing some similarities with the Jedi Order:
                                                welcoming young members, training them in combat, and instructing them to
                                                follow a path of morality. Many Sentry gang leaders have given up their leadership
                                                positions, though, as they are unwilling to lead their friends into danger
                                                for their own moral crusade.</li>

                                                galaxy. Their desire to make a difference—and to do so physically—is what
                                                first brought them into conflict with a local boss or a petty governmental

                                                and injustice. For some Sentries, this sense of ongoing purpose gives them
                                                peace of mind. For others, the turmoil between right and violence remains

                                                a Sentry can help fill this role. As one of the downtrodden, a Sentry earns
                                                the trust of local communities. However, the host planet’s police may have

                                                the host society. Where this is the case, enforcement stops at the border
                                                of the camp. In the worst case situations, authorities may use the refugees
                                                as easy scapegoats for the host planet’s own problems. A Sentry can act as
                                                an intermediatory authority, sometimes working with the host planet’s authority,
