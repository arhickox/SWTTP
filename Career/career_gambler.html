                                <p class="card-text">When the chips are down, the Gambler holds all the cards. Like the devious
                                        Thief, the Gambler loves misleading others and taking big risks to profit. Like the
                                        clever Trader, the Gambler has a knack for convincing others to part with their valuables
                                        for next to nothing. The Gambler has a unique variety of tricks up his sleeve to
                                        deceive or misdirect opponents, keeping them guessing as to whether he has a winning
                                        or losing hand. However, the Gambler knows that there is no such thing as a losing
                                        hand; winning is all about knowing how to play the cards that have been dealt.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Gambler knows how to play all the most popular games of chance;
                                        however, he also recognizes there is far more to winning than just knowing the rules.
                                        His ability to identify subtle clues in the body language, mannerisms, voice patterns,
                                        and behavior of his opponents gives the Gambler all the information he needs to decide
                                        when to make his move. The Gambler prides himself on being unpredictable, denying
                                        his opponents any hints to his intentions with his stone- cold expression. Whether
                                        the situation is a game of sabacc, betting on Podraces, or talking a thug out of
                                        blasting his companions, the Gambler has a strategy, and rarely the one people expect.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">By doubling down on skills that allow him to keep his opponents guessing,
                                        the Gambler ensures the odds are always stacked in his favor. As a competent liar,
                                        the Gambler is not above using a skifter to win a hand if the stakes are high enough.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">A Gambler may not always look like much, but looks can be deceiving.
                                        The Gambler is an excellent actor, always able to project an air of calm confidence
                                        so he seems as cool as carbonite even when he is as tense as an Alderaanian on an
                                        ImpStar. A great Gambler knows to never count his credits at the table, so to speak,
                                        but sometimes playing hurt can throw his opponents. Some Gamblers love baiting their
                                        opponents by looking vulnerable just so they can gloat while raking in the pot. A
                                        fool and his money are soon parted, and the Gambler is always happy to oblige.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Gambler is a fantastic specialization for playing a number of character
                                        types in a variety of settings. A player could create an aboveboard, aristocratic
                                        Core dweller participating in high-stakes betting just for thrills; a suave, small-time
                                        card shark flitting about the Colonies scamming amateur players; or a downtrodden
                                        Smuggler dropping his last fifty credits into the pot trying to win enough to repair
                                        his ship. He is not limited to playing games, however, as a Gambler fits into any
                                        setting where fists full of credits or unbelievable thrills are up for grabs. The
                                        negotiation skills of the Gambler could make him the brains of a trade or smuggling
                                        operation. A Thief may even supplement his abilities with Gambler to mingle among
                                        high society and case locations for upcoming jobs.</p>

                                                its ups and downs, to extremes. A Gambler could have started life as a slave
                                                but won his own freedom. He might have worked in a casino, where he picked
                                                up a few tricks before escaping his employer to begin a life of smuggling.
                                                Alternatively, he may have had wealth, lost it, gained it, and lost it again.
                                                In any case, a Gambler knows how important but elusive credits can be.</li>

                                                can mean winning big. Sometimes a Gambler knows what he is doing when he
                                                risks everything. Any Gambler who has known wealth once and lost it certainly

                                                could lose his position. Perhaps he couldn’t resist playing himself, and
