                                <p class="card-text">In peacetime, a Shipwright designs, oversees, and launches custom ships
                                        to grace the hyperspace lanes. During the era of the Republic, Shipwrights crafted
                                        ships with elegant fins, spires, and curves that made people wonder, “Who built that?”
                                        Currently, the Empire favors ship designs that express power and inspire fear. The
                                        Core World shipyards have followed suit, as the Empire remains the dominant culture
                                        in the galaxy. Elegance is a bygone ideal, a symbol of Republic corruption or a lost
                                        fancy. Even the Alliance often must eschew aesthetics for practicality and utility,
                                        something many Shipwrights in the Rebellion understand but mourn.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">In the Alliance, Shipwrights primarily maintain and repair the various
                                        ships it fields. An important secondary task is the breaking down and retrofitting
                                        of commissioned starships. Since the majority of these vessels come from smuggled
                                        sources, civilian donations, or scrapyard rescues, Shipwrights have to determine
                                        if they should be utilized, scrapped, or junked.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">For ships to be added to the Fleet, they then oversee the installation
                                        of new or updated equipment and basic repairs. Then comes crew training, space trials
                                        and testing, readying the hull for hyperspace travel, and, for some lucky Shipwrights,
                                        naming and serving aboard them.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Alliance shipyards tend to be hidden, remote, or highly mobile—often
                                        all three. As always, materials, supplies, and labor are the main factors limiting
                                        construction, along with time; at any point, the Empire may suddenly discover the
                                        location of the shipyard, prompting a rapid evacuation.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Shipwrights can work on a space station or in its shipyard. Mobile Alliance
                                        shipyards can house weapon platforms or support mining and refining facilities. The
                                        more advanced shipyards resemble a fully staffed mining colony. In such a shipyard,
                                        Shipwrights must incorporate industrial components into their designs as well as
                                        handle worker accommodations and support. At this level, Shipwrights resemble civil
                                        engineers. Even something as basic as organic waste elimination can be important
                                        to the Alliance. Only Shipwrights, for example, might know that the station’s trash
                                        disposal hold can hide an allied light freighter attempting to illude Imperial patrols!
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">On the rare occasion when the Alliance requires a new ship design, Shipwrights
                                        usually must throw aesthetics out the transparisteel window to aim for utility, safety,
                                        and reliability. Primarily, their designs must try to ensure that the ship and its
                                        crew can accomplish the mission and hopefully return in one piece. Good Shipwrights
                                        keep in mind that their creations should be easy to repair, offer a modicum of comfort,
                                        and be able to throw enough firepower at enemies to make crews happy to fly aboard
                                        them into victory.</p>

                                                Shipwrights are more skilled in theory than in practical, hands-on ship building
                                                or maintenance. These individuals know a lot about how ships are built and

                                                about fighting them. Shipwrights with this background are primarily employed
                                                by Alliance R&D groups, developing new ships for the Rebel Navy and upgrading

                                                impossible, fanciful ships that defy the norms of naval architecture. They
                                                constantly strive to expand the boundaries of starship performance and design,
                                                often pushing new and untested technologies into production before they are
                                                quite ready, with dangerous results. The Alliance’s B-wing starfighter is
                                                a perfect example of a ship designed by an eccentric Shipwright, and a very
                                                successful example at that. Many designs and prototypes developed are neither
                                                as successful nor as viable as the B-wing; however, those that are successful
                                                often make valuable additions to the Alliance Fleet.</li>

                                                Mechanics on the Alliance leadership’s most wanted list. As an organization
                                                that lives and dies by its mobility, the Rebel military relies heavily on
                                                its starships— ships that are often ancient, heavily used, and held together
                                                with tape, wire, and wishes. Journeymen Shipwrights often have experience

                                                typically do not possess. Their experiences in all manner of starships, often
                                                trading work for passage, gives journeyman Shipwrights an edge.

                                                to amateur Mechanics. They tend to obsess over ship classes and starfighters,
                                                read exhaustively on naval architecture and history, volunteer at museums,
                                                and generally consume as much information as they can about the building
                                                and maintenance of starships. Many find work on backwater worlds where trained
                                                Shipwrights are rare and expensive. They make do with secondhand tools and
                                                lean heavily on the HoloNet and shipyard manuals to diagnose problems. Although
