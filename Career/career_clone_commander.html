                                <p class="card-text">The biogeneticists on Kamino understand that a
                                        clone army needs specialized commanders. While
                                        non-clone commanders could serve the function, the
                                        Kaminoans wished to sell a fully staffed military as a
                                        whole package and took on the challenge of providing an independent thinker with unwavering loyalty
                                        to their buyer. A Clone Commander can come from
                                        the soldier’s ranks, having shown a natural ability to
                                        command, or can be engineered on Kamino through
                                        specialty training. The Jedi lean on these commanders to advise them, enforce discipline, and execute
                                        the Jedi’s orders.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">A Clone Commander leads a regiment of four battalions of four companies each, taking orders directly
                                        from the Jedi on the field. They must think large scale,
                                        advising the Jedi on tactical and strategic matters,
                                        questioning when appropriate, but following orders
                                        when commanded. They must also interpret those
                                        orders, making sure they can accomplish the Jedi’s
                                        goals while keeping casualties low. Lastly, they must
                                        pay attention to logistics and supply lines, ensuring
                                        that their regiments can hold the territory they take
                                        or have the ability to wage an offensive.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Recreation time provides little relaxation for a
                                        commander, and “free time” is often given over to administrative work. “If the droids don’t get me, the paperwork
                                        will” is a common refrain among command staff. On the other hand, this reinforces accountability. A
                                        regular record keeps a commander informed of his
                                        resources. Debriefings and planning sessions provide an
                                        opportunity to reflect and learn from past decisions. A
                                        commander is always prepared to explain to his superiors why he used an asset or chose a certain tactic.                                        
                                        </p>
                                <p class="card-text">In addition, a good commander must defend his
                                        troopers from administrative flak from above. Blame
                                        rolls downhill, and a commander who cannot shield
                                        his soldiers from blame engenders little loyalty from
                                        his subordinates and threatens to undermine his own
                                        authority. This also works the other way; information flows upward, from troopers to commanders to
                                        generals. A commander acts as a filter, making sure
                                        grousing and complaints don’t spread among the
                                        troops, but delivering important information about
                                        troop status, enemy locations and potential dangers
                                        to the mission to get analyzed and processed.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">These responsibilities illustrate the power commanders do and do not have. They have a responsibility to
                                        the lives of each individual soldier in their regiment.
                                        At the same time, the success or failure of a campaign
                                        rests on their shoulders. They must weigh the possibility of a high casualty and fatality list against the
                                        benefits of a victory. Though they know that all clones
                                        are ready to sacrifice their lives for the greater cause,
                                        commanders cannot depend on that spirit alone. With
                                        planning, preparation, and a little luck; they can bring
                                        their brothers home in one piece.</p>
