                                <p class="card-text">An old military sayinggoes something like thisâ€”"Empty stomachs make
                                        for poor soldiers." The Quartermaster's job is to ensure this doesn't happen to the
                                        troops he supports. He also must ensure that weapons, ammunition, medical supplies,
                                        and everything else needed gets where it should be and into the right hands. Managing
                                        the flow of logistics is one of the most difficult tasks in any military organization,
                                        and the Quartermaster is the master of it.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Searching and manipulating data to their unit's benefit is a trick many
                                        Quartermasters employ, as is finding (and stealing) necessary resources when the
                                        cupboards are otherwise bare. Anyone involved in supply is inherently enamored of
                                        preparedness at all times.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The greatest commanders in any military place extraordinary emphasis
                                        on supply, relying heavily on their Quartermasters to see to it that logistical needs
                                        are met at all times. An otherwise-successful campaign will come to a screeching
                                        halt, perhaps even degrading into a terrible rout, if supply lines are not maintained
                                        and the warriors engaged with the enemy lose access to food, ammunition, and other
                                        vital needs. The Quartermaster understands the unique and challenging puzzle of finding,
                                        securing, and moving assets, and he seeks to fulfill his unit's needs no matter what
                                        is required.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">One of the greatest challenges for the Alliance is that of supply; the
                                        best Quartermasters in service to the Rebellion are indispensable assets. As long
                                        as other Alliance units are not endangered by their actions, Quartermasters are given
                                        great leeway in their methods for acquiring needed resources and getting them to
                                        the front lines. Many of the best Quartermasters indulge in more than a little larceny,
                                        often targeting criminal organizations and even the Empire itself to get what they
                                        need.

                                                many Imperial soldiers and pilots have deserted in the wake of the horrors
                                                the Empire has wrought, so too have many Quartermasters abandoned their posts
                                                to fight the evil hegemony they once served.</li>
