                                <p class="card-text">Not all debts need to be settled with blasters. Sometimes, a Bounty
                                        Hunter just needs to do some
                                        legwork, find a target, and get that individual to pay
                                        what is owed with a few well-chosen words. This is the
                                        specialty of Skip Tracers, who take on commissions to
                                        seek out people with unpaid debts from clients who
                                        wish to have items returned, cash given back, or recompense paid in some other
                                        way. Most Skip Tracers
                                        prefer to keep their guns holstered for the whole job,
                                        and try their utmost to avoid causing negotiations with their targets
                                        to break down explosively. Property destruction and medical
                                        bills cut into the commission, after all. Of course,
                                        as most Skip Tracers
                                        know all too well, things
                                        rarely go so smoothly.
                                        More often, the Skip
                                        Tracer ends up needing to apply pressure somewhere along the line, whether this
                                        takes the form
                                        of gaining leverage on the target or delivering a threat
                                        of violence—at the hands of the client or otherwise.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">All Bounty Hunters have access to investigative abilities through
                                        access to Perception and Streetwise as career
                                        skills, but Skip Tracers are particularly strong at this
                                        aspect of the job. Several Skip Tracer talents are especially useful when backed
                                        by
                                        a high Cunning or Intelligence; Improved
                                        Street Smarts and Reconstruct the Scene
                                        let Skip Tracers find leads on even the
                                        scantest of evidence, and Bypass
                                        Security can help these investigators
                                        reach secured locations where their
                                        targets might be hiding. Through dedication and keen insight, Skip Tracers can
                                        locate and pursue a target across nearly
                                        any distance, which makes them ideal for
                                        finding people who wish to avoid notice.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Skip Tracers also benefit from an investment
                                        in their Presence, as once they find their marks,
                                        they must convince them to part with what is
                                        owed. Several of the Skip Tracer’s talents, such
                                        as Good Cop and Nobody’s Fool make it difficult for targets to get the better of
                                        Skip Tracers in negotiations, and ensure that they
                                        recover the client’s property. If matters do
                                        become ugly, however, Skip Tracers are
                                        not defenseless: Hard-Boiled and Rapid
                                        Recovery allow Skip Tracers to doggedly
                                        pursue their quarry even after taking
                                        a beating, and Soft Spot lets them
                                        slip a finishing blow through at
                                        exactly the right moment, even
                                        against a tough opponent.</p>

                                                throughout the galaxy. Always on the move, they have
                                                the common expenses of their profession—ship and

                                                such a list of contacts involves a massive outlay of

                                                that other hunters rarely need to address. Skip Trac￾ers know the value
