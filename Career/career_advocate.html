                        <div class="card-body">
                                <p class="card-text">The Advocate is all about acting subtly through others, offering guidance
                                        and aid to friends and manipulating enemies into exposing their own weaknesses. Great
                                        comrades and terrible foes, the best Advocates know exactly when to use which set
                                        of skills. Advocates can stand on their own as social characters, and are exceptionally
                                        effective when collaborating with Agitators, Ambassadors, or other charismatic characters
                                        who draw attention to themselves. By staying on the fringes of the limelight, guiding
                                        friends and manipulating enemies, Advocates can often do their best work.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Not all politicians contribute to the cause through stirring speeches
                                        to win the hearts and minds of the public. Part political strategist and part counselor,
                                        the Advocate uses argumentation and insight to expose the flaws in political opponents
                                        and accentuate the best qualities of allies. A skilled Advocate turns the words of
                                        a foe back upon him or rephrases a friend’s thoughtless comment, casting it in a
                                        positive light. Backed by an Advocate, even a political novice can become a force
                                        to be reckoned with, and a truly skilled politician can soar to untold heights of
                                        power and influence.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Their skills reflect an Advocate’s need to remain alert at all times,
                                        and his tendency to undertake tasks others might find onerous or unethical. Vigilance
                                        helps an Advocate determine when a situation is growing dangerous, while Coercion
                                        is crucial to badgering opponents into backing down once the Advocate has the right
                                        piece of evidence in hand.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Advocates approach the negotiation table in several different ways.
                                        Some seek to act entirely behind the scenes, writing speeches or giving guidance
                                        to assist more personable politicians. Others hurl themselves into the fray, undermining
                                        opponents with a solidly constructed argument or strengthening the rhetoric of political
                                        allies by subjecting it to the harshest scrutiny. A good Advocate can be a trusted
                                        mentor or a hated rival, and a great Advocate knows how to be either one as the situation
                                        demands.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Advocates work best within a group, either backing up a skilled speaker
                                        or elevating a less experienced but more personable character to act as the faction’s
                                        public face. While an Advocate can apply pressure effectively, his greatest potential
                                        is in the role of a mentor or manipulator, directing other, more visible actors.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">A veteran Diplomat might want to take Advocate as a second specialization
                                        after investing heavily in interpersonal skills, combining the rhetorical skills
                                        of another specialization with the Advocate’s emphasis on applying pressure to get
                                        results. Alternatively, a Soldier, Spy, or other character with a more combat-oriented
                                        focus might find the Advocate helpful as a secondary specialization, enabling that
                                        character to more effectively contribute to social encounters.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">An Advocate benefits greatly from a high Cunning or Willpower characteristic.
                                        One who invests in both can be extremely flexible in social situations, filling the
                                        role of mentor, manipulator, mediator, or attack dog as the circumstances of the
                                        negotiation require. Whatever skills the character wields to this end, a good Advocate
                                        gets results above all.</p>

                                                usually know the relevant laws backward and forward, and can use them to
