                                <p class="card-text">Force Adherents worship the Force and accept its influence over the
                                        galaxy. The Force binds all living things, and those who surrender to this idea are
                                        able to reach a level of perception unknown to the common sentient. Even those without
                                        sensitivity to the Force have benefited from this acceptance. Through this belief,
                                        Force Adherents are capable of overcoming extreme adversity.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Belief in the Force is most commonly associated with the Jedi legends,
                                        but multiple cultures throughout the galaxy recognize the same phenomenon. For example,
                                        the Lasat, whom many believe to be extinct, worship the Ashla, a personification
                                        of the light side of the Force, and acknowledge the Bogan, a personification of the
                                        dark side of the Force. Gand findsmen utilize techniques that outsiders view as directly
                                        related to the Force as well. For these cultures, the idea of the Force, however
                                        it is represented, is an accepted part of their identity. While it is natural for
                                        members from these groups to worship the Force, others from outside these cultures
                                        are drawn to Force worship as well.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">For sentients seeking purpose, turning to the Force can provide guidance.
                                        Whether their seeking is triggered by a general sense of meaninglessness or a specific,
                                        personal loss, the idea of the Force is a reassuring constant. For these individuals,
                                        the rituals, practices, and holy places of Force worship give direction. Making pilgrimages
                                        to established Force locations like Jedha, for instance, is frequently an integral
                                        part of these Force Adherents’ journeys. However, not all Force Adherents come to
                                        their worship for meaning or guidance.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">To those who have seen or heard about the incredible deeds of Force-users,
                                        such as the Jedi, worship of the Force tantalizes with the possibility of unlocking
                                        that strength. Unfortunately for those who seek this power, not all individuals are
                                        sensitive to the Force. Regardless, those who pursue Force worship earnestly find
                                        a strength they can unlock within themselves.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">By developing their understanding of the Force, Force Adherents become
                                        more in tune with the galaxy. Even if they cannot tap into the Force directly, they
                                        learn to listen to the life around them; where most sentients hear only noise, Force
                                        Adherents hear the spiritual call and response of the entire range of beings in the
                                        area. In addition, Force Adherents’ meditative contemplation and training allow them
                                        to push their bodies past normal limitations. An unwavering belief in the providence
                                        of the Force can even eliminate fear of failure, because all is as the Force wills
                                        it.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Force Adherents’ worship and training make them more-than-capable fighters,
                                        and their knowledge of the Force is practically unrivaled. Due to their enhanced
                                        perceptions and reflexes, they are capable of anticipating opponents’ actions in
                                        combat. They excel at evading attacks and delivering precise blows. Challenges to
                                        Force Adherents are challenges to the flow of the Force itself.
