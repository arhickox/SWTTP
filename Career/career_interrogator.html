                                <p class="card-text">Aportion of the most critical military intelligence is never officially
                                        documented. Some parts might not even seem like valuable information at first. A
                                        Slicer may never uncover a minister’s esoteric hobbies that could be used for blackmail.
                                        An Infiltrator might not recognize that an old plaque conceals a datachip loaded
                                        with secrets. Skilled Interrogators, however, can uncover secrets that their subjects
                                        might not even recognize they possess. Often, this requires that the subject be captured
                                        first, but some operatives are so skilled and subtle that they can extract secrets
                                        from targets through casual conversation without letting the targets realize what
                                        has happened. These specialists grant the Rebellion unexpected and unorthodox advantages
                                        that it needs to succeed against enormous odds.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">In order to successfully question a target, an Interrogator needs to
                                        have some background info about the subject, possibly including personality traits,
                                        loved ones, and interests, in addition to knowing what type of information to seek.
                                        Personal history is critical to gaining leverage over a target. Interrogators must
                                        be versed in a range of information extraction techniques so that they can determine
                                        the best method for a particular foe. Physical coercion can work effectively against
                                        some enemies, but for others, psychological attacks are far more efficient. Recognizing
                                        the best technique and having the appropriate tools readily available makes each
                                        interrogation faster and the results more reliable.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">A physically imposing questioner may rely upon violence, and this technique
                                        can sometimes be effective. However, it is invariably cruel. Further, Imperial officers
                                        are trained to resist these techniques, reducing their efficacy. Additionally, some
                                        subjects recognize that the consequences for giving in to this type of torture can
                                        be as severe as those for resisting it. For these reasons, the most effective of
                                        interrogations eschew physical techniques for social ones.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Many Interrogators instead use a combination of Charm and Deception
                                        to effectively draw information from their subjects. They may intimidate through
                                        threats—often to the subject’s friends, family, or special interests—rather than
                                        direct violence. Demonstrations of power over those other parties can provide additional
                                        leverage, though such demonstrations may be fabricated as necessary.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Either type of Interrogator may educate allies on the best ways to resist
                                        enemy questioning, something even non-combatants in the Alliance may face at some
                                        point. This may involve working with students in simulated questioning sessions,
                                        but it can also incorporate observation of the Interrogator at work. Crucial to either
                                        approach is having students watch people while they are breaking, partly so that
                                        students can recognize what this looks like, but also to help them identify the types
                                        of leverage that might be used against them, so that they can work to mitigate the
                                        effectiveness of those tactics.
