                                <p class="card-text">With the skills of a survivalist, the instincts of a bounty hunter,
                                        and the courage of a madman, the Big-Game Hunter tends to baffle everyone with his
                                        desire to actively track down, confront, and do battle with the most terrifying creatures
                                        in the galaxy. He understands and respects the environments he must contend with
                                        in order to pursue his quarry, yet he is less interested in where he is going than
                                        in what he is going to kill when he gets there.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Though some true pacifists may take great exception to the notion, Big-Came
                                        Hunters tend to believe they are performing a service to the people of the galaxy.
                                        They generally seek out truly dangerous and deadly creatures to fight and kill, thus
                                        making more areas in the galaxy safe for sentient habitation.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Big-Game Hunters tend to know how to get where their prey is, how to
                                        stay alive once they get there, and all about whatever it is they are there to do
                                        battle with.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Of course, there are plenty of hunters who are more than willing to
                                        kill pretty much anything that can net them a hefty profit, whether for pelts, horns,
                                        organs, or whatever else someone is willing to pay for. There are some hunters who
                                        take specific contracts from local governments to thin out a herd of something that
                                        is growing too large or to eliminate particularly enraged (and possibly infected)
                                        creatures that pose a danger to civilization.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">For a Player Character, a Big-Game Hunter may not seem like a good fit
                                        at first. However, his general Explorer capabilities combined with his survival skills
                                        and his talent for fighting particularly dangerous foes may well make him a linchpin
                                        for a group's success. Many Big-Game Hunters will take whatever jobs they can find
                                        out in the Rim just for the chance to travel to new places and see what there is
                                        to hunt.</p>

                                                types, but something can be said for knowing all there is to know about one's
                                                prey and its habitat. Thinking of things the other way around, who best to
                                                teach a class on the ecology of the rancor than someone who has hunted and
                                                fought one to the death? One interesting background to consider is the conservation-
                                                minded academic who takes to the field to track and find exotic alien beasts.
                                                Perhaps he does so not to kill them but to learn more about them and ensure
                                                their continued existence as civilization expands into their habitats.</li>

                                                their hunt takes them into restricted areas. Killing a massive and dangerous
                                                beast may mean a great moment of glory for the hunter, but doing so on lands
                                                belonging to the local lord can carry a death sentence. Of course, being
                                                particularly skilled at hunting the strongest and most dangerous creatures
                                                in the galaxy means Big-Came Hunters make prime candidates for recruitment
                                                in hunting more sentient prey, and criminal overlords may pay quite handsomely
                                                to eliminate particularly tough foes.</li>

                                                themselves great predators. This is how best to make enough money to go after
                                                the prey they truly seek. Others act as bounty hunters, knowing their skill

                                                seek to do, but it pays the bills. A smart hunter who heads out to the Rim
                                                or beyond goes with a plan to keep his funds up so that he can stay on the

                                                out as members of the Imperial military structure, discovering a taste for
                                                hunting and killing particularly nasty beasts while occupying or pacifying
                                                a particular planet. They may have been special forces of some kind, in charge

                                                ambitions he had. Whether he retired or simply abandoned his post, he's set
