                                        with
                                        terrible odds (more often than not, an acquisition has friends or employees who
                                        work
                                        hard to protect him), it's not surprising how many specialize in high-tech gear
                                        and
                                        weapons. The Gadgeteer excels at presenting himself as a one-person battle
                                        force,
                                        at least for a short time. Using both the latest tech and his own
                                        personally-modified
                                        gear, a Bounty Hunter with this specialization can be hard to stop. Gadgeteer
                                        talents
                                        lean heavily towards gear use, taking down targets, and adapting to tough
                                        situations.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Gadgeteer-specialized Bounty Hunters are in many ways the ultimate

                                        of tech expert and combatant; for smaller groups, this may be a perfect choice.
                                        Gadgeteers—especially
                                        those that are operating as Independent Bounty Hunters—have little trouble

                                        on for nearly any job. After all, the credits they need for that next nifty

                                        of tech have to come from somewhere.</p>
