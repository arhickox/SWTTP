                                <p class="card-text">Many people think of the body as a machine. After all, it can fulfill
                                        complex functions, must be maintained, and wears down over time. When pieces of the
                                        body fail or need to be repaired, cyberneticists can help restore function and improve
                                        the qualiLy of patients' lives. While many Cyber Techs focus their craft emirely
                                        on replacing the lost or damaged body parts of patients, others see no reason not
                                        to upgrade and modify bodies just as they would other tools.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Cyber Tech specialization gives a Technician a way to explore the
                                        realm of medicine, using technical and biological know how to craft and maintain
                                        cybernetics. as well as Lo integrate them into living bodies. Given this ability
                                        to skillfully alter bodies with cybernetics. Most Cyber Techs perform at least some
                                        upgrades on themselves. The degree and subtlety of an individual Cyber Tech's upgrades
                                        tend to depend on the individual's culture. species. and personal beliefs. Within
                                        some cultures, extensive cybernetic augmentation is considered unusual or even taboo.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Despite the advantages of cybernetics, which many Cyber Techs are quick
                                        to point out, most humans and members of many other species tend not to seek out
                                        substantial enhancemem unless absolutely necessary. Replacing a lost limb with a
                                        cybernetic one is common sense, but for most, the prospect of lopping off a healthy
                                        limb to replace it with a stronger one is another maLler entirely. Still, among most
                                        sentient species with the necessary technology, there are those who have reasons
                                        for wanting to surpass flesh.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Other groups and individuals hold no such qualms about removing flesh,
                                        bones, and organs to replace them with what Cyber Techs see as undoubtedly superior
                                        components. Ganks, for instance, are a species known for their heavy use of cybernetic
                                        augmenLation; completely unmodified Ganks are very rare. Droids. of course, have
                                        a special relationship with artificial limbs, and most droids desire periodic part
                                        replacements for maintenance.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">A Cyber Tech can take on extra cybernetics, and can improve augmentations
                                        far beyond their normal capacities. Further, a Cyber Tech can assist comrades with
                                        medical care and by replacing body parts with cybernetics, though most beings only
                                        accept this help after losing a body part no matter how fervently the Cybcr Tech
                                        speaks to the virtues of replacing squishy, unreliable flesh and organs with cold,
                                        sturdy steel.

                                                to gravity itself. In the face of hardship, life leverages its environment
                                                to its advantage. For intelligent forms of life, this frequently includes
                                                the development of mechanical prosthetics by Cyber Techs. However, sentient
                                                beings are as varied as they are adaptable, and cybernetic technologies are
                                                not a one-size-fits-all proposition. Not all species have nervous systems
                                                that function in the same way—and some do not have them at all, at least
                                                in the traditional sense. By seeking out the myriad ways in which different
                                                intelligent species across space and time have enhanced their bodies, a Cyber

                                                unbelievably advanced, capable of not only mimicking the function of a
                                                lost limb, but even of transmitting sensations to the user just like a flesh
                                                and blood equivalent. However, some Cyber Techs are hardly content to rest
                                                on these laurels. For these individuals, cybernetics are not merely a means
                                                to restore lost functionality, but an opportunity to pursue abilities a
                                                fully organic being could never attain. These Tech Designers frequently do
                                                not confine their ideas to the traditional form of a species, instead designing
                                                cybernetics that fulfill their functions best. These “optimizations” might
                                                be as small as additional limbs for added utility or as vast as completely
                                                replacing the body with a frame of wire and steel. While many cringe at
                                                such a thought, these innovators hold with certainty that, as always, progress

                                                take them apart in the first place. A Cyber Tech might have once been kept
