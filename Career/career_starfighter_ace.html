                                        forms of battle imaginable. Their shields and armor—for starfighters that have either—
                                        offer virtually no resistance to the weapons of the capital ships they oppose. Instead,
                                        they must trust in the Force to protect them as they launch their daring assaults.
                                        Those who embrace the risks of space combat may pursue the Starfighter Ace specialization.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Starfighter Ace's skill set provides the essentials needed to successfully
                                        pilot a starfighter in combat. Force adepts who acquire these skills most often control
                                        single-passenger craft, in which they must assume responsibility for weapons at the
                                        same time that they handle navigation.</p>

                                        exhausting. Even with a full range of technological enhancements, effective pilots
                                        must be capable of enduring rapid and extreme shifts in velocity and direction. They
                                        must also remain ready to strike a deadly blow against an opponent at just the right
                                        instant, even while struggling to endure extreme physiological conditions.</p>

                                                tragedy may occur there through accident or design. The Starfighter Ace who
                                                acts as an avenger does not necessarily have to face the moral implications
                                                of vengeance on the personal level that other Warriors often do. For this
                                                character, vengeance might mean taking down enemy ships like the ones that
                                                destroyed a pilot, ship, or station the character once lost. Alternatively,
                                                this character might simply carry the pain of loss and vent this anger from
                                                behind the controls of a starfighter.

                                                the cause of the Rebellion. Many battles against the Empire occur in space,
                                                and a Starfighter Ace is uniquely capable of excelling in this most demanding
                                                arena. If this character considers rebelling against the Empire a just cause,
                                                then assisting oppressed citizens, destroying blockades, and encouraging
                                                planets to fight against the regime are all worthy undertakings.

                                                a Starfighter Ace is one of the best. This character is willing to fly and
                                                fight for credits, but that doesn’t mean the character does not enjoy those
                                                things for their own sake, too. This character likely puts credits straight
                                                back into the ship that helped earn them, funding repairs and improvements

                                                Warrior who knows all the military maneuvers and procedures of that organization.
                                                Force-sensitive instincts might make this character a better pilot who initially
                                                impresses superiors within a militia. However, the fear of discovery could
