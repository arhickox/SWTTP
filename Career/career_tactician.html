                                <p class="card-text">All of the victories in space, in the air, and even on the ground mean
                                        nothing if the winning force cannot hold the territory taken. At the end of the day,
                                        a few troops with blasters and bombs can disable any installation, disrupt an entire
                                        defensive grid, and create the conditions of victory. They do so under the courageous
                                        and savvy leadership of a Tactician.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Tacticians often insist on being able to fight even without weapons
                                        if called upon to do so, and many prefer heavier weapons for combat. Additionally,
                                        they are the ones who must be true leaders, even in the face of the worst possible
                                        odds.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">When all is going well, a Tactician tends to be the person the rest
                                        of a team grouses about over too much work, monotonous duties, and repeated training.
                                        However, when the blaster fire is flying and people are screaming and dying all around,
                                        the team looks to the Tactician to lead them, whether it's out of danger or into
                                        glory. A Tactician assesses the situation at all times, looking for the best way
                                        to accomplish the mission and keep his people alive. His team depends on him for
                                        these skills.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">By Alliance philosophy, Tacticians are made, not born. Battlefield promotions
                                        happen constantly, for Alliance ground forces suffer the greatest losses constantly.
                                        Those who show any capacity for leadership are brought up in rank rapidly when the
                                        need calls. Others are cultivated more fully for the most important and dangerous
                                        missions. The Alliance is blessed with a high proportion of talented individuals;
                                        what it needs are special individuals who can organize and lead them.</p>

                                                most prestigious occupation in the Imperial war machine. Nevertheless, the
                                                Imperial Army is a powerful organization with limitless personnel and excellent
                                                equipment. Former Imperial Tacticians get acquainted with the brutality of
                                                combat early on, and many of them question the ethics of terror tactics.
                                                Taking ground is one thing, but murdering innocents serves no tangible purpose.
                                                It isn’t unusual for such individuals to defect to the Rebel Alliance, and
                                                some view their decision as the only thing that can save their soul.</li>

                                                rarity, and those who are usually come from law enforcement backgrounds.
                                                Other Tacticians were once war scholars and historians, familiar with small
                                                and large unit tactics due to their chosen area of study. Still, there are
                                                those who participate in mock combats, either on holographic tabletops or
                                                in skirmishes on civilian “stun ranges,” where fun and safety are the rule
                                                rather than the exception. Though they may be derided by the trained soldiers
                                                they serve with, many find their experiences a boon on the battlefield.</li>

                                                fear the most. Whether a Tactician planned a failed raid on an enemy facility,
                                                or chose to hit a flank the Empire had secretly reinforced, he’s lost a significant
                                                number of troops due to his own miscalculations. His own self-confidence
                                                is shaken, and he feels—rightly or wrongly—that the trust his troops and
