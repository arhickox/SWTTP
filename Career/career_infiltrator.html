                                <p class="card-text">When most people hear the word Spy, the operatives of this specialization
                                        are what come to mind. Infiltrators endeavor to place themselves in the very den
                                        of the beast, usually sneaking or lying their way in undetected. All too often, Infiltrators
                                        face the worst possible odds without the benefit of direct backup, and frequently
                                        without a way out if they are discovered by the wrong people at the wrong time.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Masters of covert work, Infiltrators know how to con or lie their way
                                        past almost anyone, and they know all of the tricks necessary to break into and out
                                        of secure locations, as well as everything else needed for underhanded operations.
                                        They tend to prefer silent and deadly attacks, often best accomplished with hand-to-hand
                                        weapons.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">An Infiltrator rarely relies upon brute force or direct confrontation
                                        to accomplish his goals. Instead, he uses stealth, guile, subterfuge, and disguise
                                        to integrate himself among his enemies. He gains access to sensitive areas, talks
                                        to the right people, and employs every other available tactic to obtain valuable
                                        information, steal important secrets and assets, and leave behind a target who is
                                        reeling from his efforts.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Lately, Infiltrators are used by the Alliance as part of special strike
                                        teams sent throughout Imperial-controlled space, where they are used in combined
                                        operations intended to disrupt the Empire's plans while gathering information at
                                        the same time. For more direct combat missions, Infiltrators tend to operate in a
                                        support role. When the mission calls for subterfuge and more covert operations, Infiltrators
                                        are often the ones in charge.</p>
