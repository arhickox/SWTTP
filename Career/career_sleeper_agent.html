                                <p class="card-text">Spies must be able to tell convincing lies. Often, a lie only needs
                                        to hold up for a few seconds—just long enough for the agent to complete a crime.
                                        In some cases, the lie must be more convincing and survive much more detailed scrutiny.
                                        Sleeper Agents must be able to operate in isolation from their support network for
                                        months or even years at a time. During such missions, operatives should blend seamlessly
                                        into their host environments, never arousing even the slightest suspicion. Sustaining
                                        believable lies for this much time requires dedication so that no hint of their real
                                        identity ever emerges. For some Sleeper Agents, their artificial guises are so ingrained
                                        that it takes effort to emerge from them once a lengthy mission is finally over.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">On a mission, the vast majority of Sleeper Agents’ time involves working
                                        a mundane job that may seem unrelated to their objective. In a few cases, the job
                                        is a military one, but those assignments require extensive security checks. More
                                        often, the Sleeper Agent works a civilian job that may have military connections.
                                        The agent may even serve as a member of a criminal organization. Whichever is the
                                        case, the Sleeper Agent’s duties offer peripheral access to a resource that is of
                                        great interest to the Rebellion. It is vitally important that agents remain constantly
                                        discreet about their true intentions.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">All Sleeper Agents must be proficient in some profession that is not
                                        inherently related to uncovering military intelligence for the Rebellion. They might
                                        not need to be experts, but they must be able to convincingly assume an unremarkable
                                        civilian or military career. This act must be sustained for an extended period of
                                        time while the operatives wait to have their missions activated. Some missions focus
                                        entirely upon placing agents in critical places so that they can be activated to
                                        avert a currently unknown crisis. In these cases, the agents might pursue their cover
                                        career for years. Other missions have established timeframes or discrete objectives
                                        that the operative must pursue without raising suspicion.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Critically, Sleeper Agents must remain unflinchingly loyal to their
                                        cause. At the same time, they must be able to maintain the illusion that they are
                                        loyal to the enemy. In the case of extended assignments, they must build friendships
                                        and working relationships with their foes—relationships that they know they will
                                        eventually betray. Few individuals are capable of maintaining this level of duplicity
                                        without developing some level of emotional attachment. Such attachment incurs terrible
                                        risk, as it could lead to hesitation at a critical juncture.
