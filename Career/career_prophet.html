                                        The Jedi Order’s proselytizing ebbed and flowed, much as the Force did throughout the Old Republic. Understanding of the
                                        Force couldn’t be pressured upon a student without causing resentment and anger,
                                        which promises a fall toward the dark side. So for Prophets, they proselytized not
                                        to convert, but to offer a voice of hope and an opportunity to learn about the power
                                        of the Force.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Now, with the Jedi Order destroyed and the Galactic Republic shattered,
                                        Prophets carry a fervor not seen before in the history of the galaxy. To them, their
                                        knowledge of the light side of the Force reflects the struggle against the dark.
                                        If the Galactic Empire is the shadow blotting out the stars, then Prophets are single
                                        points of light, hoping to ignite a candle here and there to light up the sky.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Like Advisors, this specialization directly interacts with people, granting
                                        them insight and counsel when needed. Unlike Advisors, Prophets address the crowd,
                                        not the individual. Their message has to reach as many ears as possible, in the hope
                                        that their ideas or warnings catch fire. Prophets influence communities, cities,
                                        or even planets if given a medium and a message.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">The medium comes in a variety of forms: a sermon on a soapbox or an
                                        altar, a HoloNet posting or recording, flyers or tracts passed from hand to claw,
                                        or even images on a poster, painting, or pirate transmission. It doesn’t matter what
                                        medium, only the passion and truth of the message.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">The message might be filtered through a religious lens, but not always.
                                        Prophets are keyed into the Cosmic Force more keenly, and images of the future provide
                                        wisdom, guidance, and, for followers, an identity. Since Prophets are only mortal,
                                        they can only try to interpret with mortal concepts and metaphors. They then have
                                        to translate that message into simple language, further diluting the content. The
                                        next person’s limited understanding then further alters that message. The real question
                                        is whether this constant alteration by verbal or visual transmission distorts the
                                        message or enhances it just as the Force intended.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Prophets who use their abilities for evil or selfish ends have an easier
                                        time now during the Galactic Civil War. Those suffering from the Empire’s rule want
                                        a voice of hope to give them a reason to live on, and as long as the message doesn’t
                                        violate Imperial restrictions on religion or political sedition, Prophets can enjoy
                                        a safe (and profitable) career. Even on planets free from the Empire, other sources
                                        of oppression (slavery, Hutt influence, corporate interests, and the like) may drive
                                        people to a religious charlatan, especially one who can produce miracles.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Even well-meaning Prophets should be wary, since it is much too easy
                                        for them to insert their own desires, needs, or fears into their visions, distorting
                                        them into their own ends, manipulating their followers into believing their own
                                        egos.

                                                sound and word, mixing and matching the cadence of language with metaphor.
                                                Pitch, tone, and volume helped convey their message as much as the content.
                                                Not surprisingly, these proto-Prophets started off as spoken-word poets and
                                                singers, sometimes in a religious choir, but just as often as street performers.
                                                When people, with no prompting whatsoever, shouted out, called back, and
                                                joined in the performance, these artists began to see words as a connecting
                                                power. From there, it didn’t take much for the artist to hear the Cosmic
                                                Force calling back.</li>
                                        <hr class="background_hr">
                                        <li><b class="bold-gold">Augurs: </b>Soon-to-be Prophets usually served a community
                                                as an augur, sometimes in a religious role, but in others proselytizing a
                                                united ethos or philosophy. They may have represented a marginalized group
                                                seeking a cohesive identity, a group of caf-house revolutionaries plotting
                                                rebellion, or even a rioting group of agricultural workers who needed a voice.
                                                These augurs didn’t simply predict the future. Their words linked each individual
                                                not only to each other, but to an ideal and legacy of resistance. In a way,
                                                these augurs served as conduits of idealism and information, and it took
                                                little to see the Force as the true source of this knowledge.

                                                futures—literal futures—and tricked groups of people into believing their
                                                spiritual nonsense. They rationalized that it didn’t harm anyone if people
                                                believed something fake. Besides, false hope is better than no hope at all.
                                                When the fabricated hope propelled people to do great things, no one was
                                                more astonished than the con artist. These individuals then realized their
                                                higher calling, and that their hope was not so false after all.
