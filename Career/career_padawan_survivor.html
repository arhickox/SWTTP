                                <p class="card-text">Order 66 effectively erased the Jedi from existence, but a small handful
                                        of Padawans across the stars managed to escape. These young apprentices watched their
                                        closest allies suddenly turn and cut down Jedi and Padawans without warning. The
                                        remaining Padawan Survivors have been forced to hide their burgeoning abilities and
                                        enter a hostile galaxy alone and unprepared for life outside of the Jedi Order. However,
                                        a few have begun to emerge to fight back against the Empire that betrayed them. Wary
                                        of a galaxy that has turned hostile, Padawan Survivors still put their faith in the
                                        Force as they were trained to do so from a young age.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">As former apprentices, these Padawans had been on the path to becoming
                                        Jedi Knights. They received training in using the Force and in a range of fighting
                                        techniques. Unfortunately, their training was dominated with classroom lessons, and
                                        few had actual practical field experience unless they were allowed to join their
                                        masters in the Clone Wars. Not only was their formal training abruptly cut short,
                                        but the availability of Jedi knowledge was severely limited after the issuing of
                                        Order 66. That day was one of the darkest in the galaxy’s history, and it devastated
                                        the rare Padawans who lived through it.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">When the Jedi were branded as traitors and their order destroyed, those
                                        rare Padawans still alive were stranded with no resources and no support: their mentors
                                        were slain, their former clone trooper allies were hunting them at the Empire’s behest,
                                        and they had no one from whom they could seek aid. In order to survive, these former
                                        apprentices were forced to seek no-questions-asked jobs or to subsist off a life
                                        of crime. If any Imperial informant began to suspect their Force abilities, they
                                        would be forced to flee.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">As a result, many of the remaining Padawans abandoned their Jedi ideals
                                        and began nomadic lives. Many actively pursued any way to blend in, hide their abilities,
                                        and subsist on their own. Not all managed to remain hidden, though, with the might
                                        of the Empire and the newly-formed Inquisitorius after them at every turn.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">While on the run, temporary allegiances were often all that was practical,
                                        as lasting bonds proved nearly impossible to maintain, especially when Padawans revealed
                                        their abilities. Saving a friend with the Force would frequently result in the friend’s
                                        abandonment out of fear of the Empire. Only those already willing to defy the Empire
                                        would take that chance. A rebel cell, for instance, could take in Force users because
                                        the lives of its members were forfeit already. For Padawan Survivors, whose lives
                                        had been shattered by the Empire, rebellion was an exceptionally tempting opportunity.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Having access to an almost-extinguished source of power, Padawan Survivors
                                        are capable of unbelievable acts. Capable fighters and practiced at disappearing,
                                        they are able to effectively supplement a covert squad of rebel fighters or smugglers
                                        alike. The Force is a powerful ally, and these former Padawans are eager to again
                                        use it openly if it means honoring their dead masters and tearing down Imperial rule.
