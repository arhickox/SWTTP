                                <p class="card-text">The Instructor is a good choice for older characters who have a lot
                                        of experience under their belts. While it applies well to battle-hardened soldiers
                                        who might train the Alliance Military’s next generation, it also works as a new specialization
                                        for any characters wishing to pass along their know-how, whatever area it may be
                                        in. After all, members of any career or specialization may very well find satisfaction
                                        in passing along their skills.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">When it comes to showing the untested masses of the galaxy how to fight
                                        and win, an excellent Instructor is crucial. After all, handing untrained enlistees
                                        a blaster and sending them into the thick of combat is a good way of getting them
                                        killed before they’ve even had a chance to make a difference. Instructors ensure
                                        that no one is sent to fight the Empire before they’re ready, preventing Rebel blood
                                        from being spilled in vain. Though their own role is primarily one of support, Instructors
                                        must also be proficient in the skills they impart to their students, making them
                                        effective soldiers when they are inevitably called to fight.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Not all Instructors need to be combat-ready, but most of those employed
                                        by the Rebel Alliance have, by necessity, at least some combat capability available
                                        to them. An Instructor must also have enough empathy to identify with students and
                                        to discern which areas they excel in and where they require improvement.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">It takes intense control to maintain a professional demeanor and concentrate
                                        on the job at hand, both for Instructors and for their recruits. Order must be maintained
                                        both on and off the field so that would-be soldiers aren’t cowed by the sights, sounds,
                                        and demands of combat. Imparting discipline to their students, especially if they’ve
                                        never held a weapon, is crucial if Instructors want to see them survive the rigors
                                        of warfare.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Some Instructors are also well versed in the use of Medicine. Not only
                                        is first aid a skill that every soldier should possess, but injuries occur all too
                                        often during intensive training. Passing on the basics of Medicine to recruits ensures
                                        that trainees can save not only their comrades, but themselves as well. If training
                                        recruits to use medpacs and synthflesh to patch up wounds is all an Instructor is
                                        assigned to do, then Medicine may very well be that character’s primary focus.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Every soldier must learn how to shoot, so many Instructors are also
                                        accomplished marksmen. Trainees not only need to know how to fire their weapon with
                                        the intention of hitting the enemy, but they must also learn how to care for and
                                        maintain it under battlefield conditions. Drilling recruits with a blaster comprises
                                        the basics of infantry training. Initial training is with an unloaded weapon, to
                                        get recruits comfortable with carrying it, used to its weight, and vaguely uncomfortable
                                        when it’s not within reach. Many hours of port-arms and awareness drills are held
                                        before a recruit is allowed to fire a fully charged blaster downrange at a target.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Though it seems to go without saying, Instructors must be well educated.
                                        Being skilled at conveying their knowledge to their students is an important part
                                        of their job description. When integrated with a Rebel cell or combat unit, Instructors
                                        can be a benefit to everyone they serve with. As teachers, they must be able to demonstrate
                                        the correct way to do something under any circumstances. It’s highly unlikely that
                                        they wouldn’t be able to show everyone a trick or two when the chips are down.</p>

                                                soldiers have their roots in a number of civilian professions, such as law
                                                enforcement, education, and (strangely enough) health and fitness. Instructors
                                                with experience in law enforcement training are capable of teaching small
                                                unit tactics, weapons use, and self- defense, while health and fitness professionals

                                                arts, and other methods. Scholars and educators are just as valuable, allowing
                                                potential Rebels to learn the theories behind warfare on a number of levels,

                                                been devised with these particular Instructors in mind. Despite their best
                                                efforts to attain a fleet appointment, a battlefield commission, or a political
