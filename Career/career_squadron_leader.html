                                <p class="card-text">Though perhaps the most important engagements involve capital ships,
                                        the daily struggle for survival and victory happens at a much smaller scale. Snubfighters,
                                        small gunships, combat airspeeders, and hovertanks go hammer-and-tongs against the
                                        massive Imperial war machine, and it's only the tactical genius and daring of those
                                        who lead these units keeping them alive. The best Squadron Leaders even manage to
                                        pull out more than their fair share of victories. Squadron Leaders tend to know their
                                        machines very well, and of course they need to be able to operate the same types
                                        of vehicles they are commanding.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Squadron Leaders rarely lead from the rear. More often than not, theirs
                                        are the first ships or vehicles to engage the enemy, and they're the last ones out
                                        of a combat zone (if they get out at all). Leading by example is a way of life for
                                        a Squadron Leader, and he won't ask anyone to do what he's not ready to do himself.
                                        He rides his team to keep their machines in top shape, and he trains them constantly.
                                        He wants both crew and machines back in the hangar when the mission is over, and
                                        he does whatever it takes to make it happen.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Alliance High Command knows every single battle is important, and most
                                        of them are won at the front line, by mechanized detachments and starhghter squadrons
                                        under the command of Squadron Leaders. The upper echelons are constantly on the lookout
                                        for anyone with the right qualities to inspire and lead pilots and vehicle crews
                                        into the worst kinds of hell and back again.</p>

                                                TIE pilots have to be the best they can be. Many Squadron Leaders developed
                                                a taste for adrenaline at the controls of an Imperial fighter, battling pirates
                                                in the Outer Rim or chasing smugglers closer to the Core. For whatever reason,
                                                they’ve taken their skills over to the other side, trading in the Empire’s
                                                flimsy TIEs for durable X-wings and maneuverable A-wings.</li>

                                                for military action. Some act as test pilots for corporate or planetary ship
                                                manufacturers, while the majority ply their trade as couriers, escorts, or
                                                transport captains. Hoping to make a difference in securing the galaxy for
                                                freedom, they have offered their skills and reflexes to the Rebel Alliance
                                                and found themselves no worse off for their lack of academy training. Those
                                                who can lead oftentimes find themselves placed in command of a fighter element,
                                                a squadron, or an entire attack wing. If only their parents could see them

                                                is bad enough, especially given the difficulty of acquiring new ships to
                                                replace those that have been lost. Losing pilots, however, is all the more
                                                serious, as talented fighter pilots don’t grow on trees. Each one lost is
                                                irreplaceable, and failed Squadron Leaders have lost most, if not all, of
                                                their pilots and starfighters in combat. The guilt and shame surrounding
                                                this loss haunts them at every moment, and replacing their pilots and ships
                                                is likely a top priority.</li>
