                        <div class="card-body">
                                <p class="card-text">The Empire is vast, but it is a mere fraction of the galaxy, and the
                                        Explorer seeks to uncover the countless mysteries and opportunities the universe
                                        contains. Explorers are both vitally important and insidiously dangerous to the New
                                        Order; on the one hand, they reveal information, trade routes, and resources that
                                        are deeply coveted by the Empire, and on the other hand, they expand the ranges into
                                        which rebels, criminals, and iconoclasts can spread out and avoid Imperial might.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Empire employs countless scouts and mercantile agents, and there
                                        are many more such entities working for the millions of galactic corporations seeking
                                        advantage over one another as they expand. The Explorer is a free agent; he makes
                                        his own way, tracks his own discoveries, and arranges his own special deals and connections.
                                        He will often sell the information he has at a decent price, or arrange to guide
                                        those who wish to go where he has been.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Other Explorers scour the HoloNet and other data services, looking for
                                        groups, businesses, or organizations in need. This is why the most well-traveled
                                        Explorers are in the greatest demand: they have maps and information about places
                                        only a fraction of a percent of the galaxy's population might knows even exist. An
                                        Explorer with data about a planet a company wishes to exploit, or with a safe route
                                        to a part of the galaxy a group wishes to use for covert operations, can demand top
                                        prices.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Any Explorer relatively new to the trade finds himself in the classic
                                        conundrumâ€”he needs experience in order to attain the choicest contracts, yet he cannot
                                        gain that experience because he cannot get hired. As such, many Explorers will take
                                        on any opportunity to travel and work in the Outer Rim, gathering what knowledge
                                        and leads they can in order to build up their contacts, resources, and their library
                                        of maps and routes. Most commonly, Explorers are able to parlay their astrogation
                                        and pilot skills into work opportunities.</p>
