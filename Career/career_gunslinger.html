                <div class="card career-text-card">
                        <div class="card-body">
                                <p class="card-text">The Outer Rim is an immense region of countless worlds, sometimes lawless
                                        but always dangerous. Life on the galactic frontier teems with vicious creatures
                                        and heartless criminals who would not think twice about gunning down innocent civilians.
                                        Bred from conflict and necessity, this is the galaxy where the Gunslinger lives and
                                        breathes. He is the best there is with a blaster, and he won’t hesitate to show it.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Gunslinger knows better than most that making a living in the Outer
                                        Rim Territories is a constant struggle. He needs to be fast on the draw to stay alive.
                                        The Gunslinger and his beloved sidearm are inseparable, but he often carries a holdout
                                        weapon when stuck in a hos tile, target-rich environment To face off with a Gunslinger
                                        is a dangerous and foolish proposition. The Gunslinger has lethal aim and an attitude
                                        to match, making him one of the deadliest beings in the Outer Rim.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">A Gunslinger often has a special bond with his favorite weapon. His
                                        knack for gunplay often earns him a reputation that puts him at odds with other bandits
                                        who want to prove their mettle. This lifestyle is second nature to the Gunslinger,
                                        so he knows how to keep his cool when threatened. When some thug sticks a blaster
                                        in his face, the Gunslinger doesn’t flinch. He shoots first and skips asking questions.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Gunslinger often needs to remain one step ahead of the law, and
                                        so he wanders the Outer Rim in search of his next job. The hard life of the galactic
                                        frontier is not all gunfights, so the Gunslinger takes on work wherever he can find
                                        it. The Gunslinger uses his underworld contacts to secure odd jobs for a variety
                                        of criminal groups. Gunslingers also use their piloting knowledge to take on freight
                                        or smuggling jobs.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">A Gunslinger character can fill countless roles within a campaign. He
                                        might find work onboard a bulk freighter defending crew and cargo from pirates. A
                                        Bodyguard might opt to pick up the Gunslinger specialization on the side to improve
                                        his ability to defend his spoiled Coruscanti debutante client. A Tapani nobleman
                                        taking up pistols a duel to maintain the honor of his house might also find the Gunslinger
                                        specialization invaluable.</p>
