                                <p class="card-text">Most Warriors pride themselves on their ability to overcome pain. A
                                        Colossus, however, possesses a toughness far beyond that. While many fighters wear
                                        their scars with pride, an experienced Colossus ripples with scar tissue, the evidence
                                        of wounds enough to kill a normal combatant a dozen times over. Where other Warriors
                                        might seek to end conflicts quickly and decisively, a Colossus possesses the stamina,
                                        endurance, and strength of will to fight through inconceivable pain and punishment,
                                        outlasting the foe no matter the odds. Their skills allow Colossi to endure great
                                        punishment both mentally and physically, and to ensure that they are prepared for
                                        even the most taxing situations and battles.

                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Knowingly or not, Colossi reflect a number of stoic Force traditions
                                        that arose throughout history. Some of these beliefs influenced the Jedi Order, particularly
                                        in teachings of the primacy of the mental and spiritual over the physical. By accepting
                                        the transience of physical pain, a Warrior can rise above it. Some arrive at such
                                        a state of mind independently, perhaps realizing (aided by a robust constitution)
                                        that physical pain is passing, and only makes them stronger.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Becoming a true Colossus is rarely a matter of formal training, and
                                        there is no single path. Few sentients have the physical endurance or the mental
                                        reserves for this approach to combat. Those who do might hone their natural abilities
                                        through a number of means, likely never quite the same. Being a Colossus may mean
                                        transcending their natural physical limitations through meditation and focus, maintaining
                                        an internal calm even in the midst of ferocious battle. Others take the opposite
                                        approach, drawing on their pain and the negative emotions it evokes to fuel themselves
                                        in combat. This latter method is representative of those who tread closer to the
                                        dark side.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Although all who fit the mold of a Colossus share certain traits when
                                        it comes to defense and longevity, they can take very different approaches to dishing
                                        out damage. There is no particular fighting style that defines a Colossus’s approach
                                        to attacking. Some might heft a heavy blaster, wading heedlessly through enemy fire
                                        to unleash a salvo. Others prefer hefty vibro-axes, swords, or other melee weapons,
                                        getting up close to enemies and trading blows, confident in their ability to take
                                        punishment and give it back in turn. Regardless of their preferred approach, Colossi
                                        are sure to have the strength to overcome an opponent with well-placed strikes should
                                        the opportunity arise.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Whether by focusing on suffering or by aspiring to higher ideals, a
                                        Colossus achieves a preternatural level of physical hardiness and toughness by drawing
                                        on the Force. A hardened Force user possesses reserves of willpower to fight on despite
                                        agonizing wounds. More importantly, Colossi can allow the Force to flow through them,
                                        using it to achieve impossible feats of endurance. They may be blasted and slashed,
                                        but their wounds do not bleed. They walk on broken legs and continue the fight, though
                                        it might worsen their injuries. They harness their pain, returning it twice over.

                                                The ability to take punishment is born from pain, so this character may be
                                                a victim who survived to take vengeance on those responsible. Such a Colossus
                                                may appear unruffled no matter what challenges arise, but has merely learned
                                                to delay any emotional reaction—awaiting the opportunity for vengeance.

                                                resilience. The Colossus accepts setbacks, and just keeps trying until they

                                                of the weak and helpless—miners who face physical danger, overworked slaves,
