                                <p class="card-text">“Padawan” means “learner,
                                        ” suggesting a deep philosophical foundation, encouraging Jedi to continually
                                        strive to learn and understand. A Padawan studies
                                        not only facts and information, but also the ideas of
                                        fluidity and flexibility, and the act of learning itself, so
                                        as to be open to understanding. Some Jedi scholars
                                        consider “Padawan” to be a state of mind rather than
                                        a title. Many a Knight has found themself revisiting
                                        the path of the Padawan to recover the balance they
                                        lost or never really had in the first place.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Once a child completes their time as an Initiate,
                                        obtains their kyber crystal, and constructs their lightsaber, they become a Padawan, an apprentice to a
                                        Jedi Knight or Master. The status, role, and function
                                        of an apprentice has changed throughout the history
                                        of the Jedi Order, but in this time of war, a Padawan
                                        acts as a runner, attache, and even lieutenant for
                                        their master. To signify their dedication to learning,
                                        a Padawan with hair ties it into a braid. A Padawan
                                        without hair might wear a band of silka beads or other
                                        appropriate material arranged around their head in
                                        a similar fashion. Upon completing their training, the
                                        Padawan cuts off the braid or beads to symbolize the
                                        severing of their attachment to their master.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Clone Wars have put the Jedi Council in a difficult position. When the war began, most Padawans
                                        had not yet faced the stresses of life in the galaxy,
                                        much less the fear and despair that come from war.
                                        They had not yet learned to command, to lead. Moreover, many Knights did not want the distraction and
                                        added responsibility of training an apprentice in the
                                        midst of a galaxy-spanning war. Practical realities
                                        forced their hands, however: Padawans needed masters, and Knights needed assistants trained in the
                                        ethics of the Jedi Code. While the clones can follow
                                        orders, the Jedi Council worried that without a subordinate who could interpret a Knight’s commands
                                        through the lens of the Force, only military, not spiritual, needs would be met. So, the council sent its
                                        Padawans to war.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Most non-Jedi do not realize that the title of
                                        Padawan represents the idea of learning and the
                                        many paths to learning. Knights and even Masters
                                        sometimes “become” Padawans again in order to get
                                        back to basics. To “open your mind as if a Padawan”
                                        means to rid oneself of preconceived notions or biases
                                        and to see things in a fresh, perhaps innocent, light.
                                        Although it is a metaphorical lesson, a few have taken
                                        this idea literally. All Initiates hear the story of the
                                        Jedi Master Vai Isa, who repeatedly took on the title
                                        of Padawan, often testing the patience of her Knights
                                        with annoying, “obvious” questions, only to come
                                        across a hidden wisdom, enlightening them both.</p>
