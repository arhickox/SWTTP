                                <p class="card-text">Every military organization depends upon its officers
                                        to function effectively. In most armies, this starts with
                                        noncommissioned officers, who work directly with
                                        line infantry, and extends to the highest-ranking generals, who devise the force’s tactics and strategies.
                                        Sometimes, an officer needs to be a friend to the soldiers for whom they are responsible. At other times,
                                        the officer represents a supreme authority, one who
                                        can tolerate no dissension. In the Grand Army of the
                                        Republic, Clone Officers assume all but the very highest level of responsibility for their fellow clones, and
                                        every officer is a career soldier.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Officers need to recognize
                                        trouble at its earliest signs and react calmly to it.
                                        They also need their soldiers to believe that they have
                                        already foreseen every possible complication and
                                        have appropriate plans to respond to each. A thorough familiarity with the army’s standard tactics and
                                        the capabilities of the units under their command are
                                        critical for implementing the appropriate strategy.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Grand Army of the Republic (GAR) includes
                                        Clone Officers at a range of ranks, based upon their
                                        level of responsibility. In some instances, clones are
                                        promoted based upon their performance, but this is
                                        not always the case. Due to the differences in training
                                        and the constant need for Clone Officers, many Clone
                                        Officers are trained to perform at a higher rank from
                                        the time they are decanted.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">A clone sergeant manages a single squad of nine
                                        troopers. In this role, they develop a close relationship
                                        working with the members of the squad. They learn
                                        the particular knacks of each clone in their unit and
                                        recognize which troopers are best suited for particular
                                        tasks. Sergeants see the same action as the rest of
                                        their squad, so they are often at the front lines.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Clone lieutenants assume responsibility for a platoon of four squads, while clone captains take charge
                                        of a company that includes four platoons. As the
                                        level of responsibility increases, so do the expectations for Clone Officers to operate independently of
                                        direct oversight. Missions often require units to operate in isolation from the larger command structure for
                                        extended periods.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Clone commander is the highest rank normally
                                        assigned to a Clone Officer within the GAR. These
                                        clones command full regiments of sixteen companies.
                                        They in turn answer to a Jedi general, and they may
                                        work closely with a Jedi commander.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Initially, Clone Officers wore color-based arm and
                                        chest identifiers on their uniforms. Sergeants wore
                                        pesto, lieutenants blue, captains maroon, and commanders yellow. This enabled every Clone Trooper
                                        to quickly identify their officers in the heat of battle,
                                        even when support systems were down. As the war
                                        has progressed, however, enemy units have exploited
                                        this easy recognition, and the Jedi have encouraged
                                        Clone Officers to uniquely identify themselves. Consequently, armor markings are becoming more
                                        personal, and the standard schemes are likely to soon
                                        be largely abandoned.</p>

                                                distinct identities. Unique acts of heroism, unusual interests, or novel insights and discoveries all
                                                offer ways to set a particular clone apart from his

                                                throughout their careers, Clone Soldiers may face
                                                the temptation to turn away from their duty. They
                                                might face overwhelming odds, encounter a generous bribe, or even have to turn their back on a

                                                their sacrifice may be necessary to secure a victory for the Republic. These soldiers are willing to

                                                try to take it further: to be the first to the objective, destroy the most droids in a skirmish, or
