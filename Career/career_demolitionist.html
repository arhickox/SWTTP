                                <p class="card-text">Demolitionists are masters of explosives and incendiary devices. Often
                                        seen as dangerous pyromaniacs, most Demolitionists possess a deep understanding of
                                        the physics behind combustion and explosion on an intuitive level as well as an academic
                                        one. They are not mindless destroyers, but artists. Demolitionists are adept at wreaking
                                        havoc while avoiding being injured by their own handiwork—most of the time.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">With their selection of skills, Demolitionists can be much more technically
                                        minded than most Hired Guns. They are also suited to much more than straightforward
                                        combat. Demolitionists can excel at setting traps, from improvised trip-wires tied
                                        to grenades to sophisticated proximity and timed explosives. Whereas another Hired
                                        Gun might go after an enemy in a straight-up fight, a Demolitionist may find a more
                                        inventive route, such as rigging a thermal detonator to explode when the target starts
                                        up his speeder. Some Demolitionists enjoy the thrill of combat as much as any other
                                        Hired Gun. However, they favor flame projectors, grenade launchers, and missile tubes—anything
                                        that creates a large blast.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The work of a Demolitionist is extremely dangerous, as a single misstep
                                        can spell doom for the character (and anyone unfortunate enough to be in the general
                                        vicinity). In order to succeed, a Demolitionist must be able to keep a clear head
                                        and focus on his work, even as blaster bolts fill the air around him. As such, most
                                        Demolitionists are adept at staying cool in the most nerve-wracking situations.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">In order to put their skills to the greatest use, Demolitionists must
                                        have an understanding of the principles of construction, as well as knowing how to
                                        construct their explosive devices. Both of these are where some skill with Mechanics
                                        becomes important. By knowing how a machine operates, or the load-bearing points
                                        of a structure, a Demolitionist can determine where to place explosives for the greatest
                                        effect. Similarly, Demolitionists know how to get the most from their tools, creating
                                        larger than expected explosions or causing devastating chain reactions. Demolitionists
                                        can use their creative talents for more than sheer destruction, and can usually be
                                        counted on to find an inventive route out of a dangerous situation. Of course, sometimes
                                        that plan is even more dangerous than the original threat.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">For many groups, having a Demolitionist around is both a blessing and
                                        a curse. Demoitionists are very effective both in combat and in any job benefitting
                                        from sabotage. However, it is far from unheard of for Demolitionists to cause unintended
                                        collateral damage when things go really wrong. Fortunately, experienced Demoitionists
                                        rarely make mistakes (even if, in their profession, many mistakes tend to be final).
                                        Most individuals operating on the fringe understand that theirs is a life of danger,
                                        and think that the benefits of partnering with a skilled Demolitionist outweigh the
                                        added risk. Still, some grow weary of keeping a constant eye on their ally lest he
                                        get carried away in his destructive interests.</p>

                                                expert is invaluable in many heists, and can quickly become infamous throughout
                                                the galaxy. However, the volatile nature of the profession means a botched
                                                job can go catastrophically wrong. After one spectacular failure, a Demolitionist's

                                                skill with high explosives has a limited number of civilian applications,
                                                so it would not be surprising that a Demolitionist would turn to mercenary

                                                on the course for veneance could be infinitely varied, but how he plans to
                                                deliver reprisal might tie directly into his particularly explosive set of
                                                skills. If the goal is simply to avenge himself through killing, this should
                                                not be too difficult. However, if the character decides that death is too
                                                easy for a hated foe, he'll have to think creatively as to how to use his
