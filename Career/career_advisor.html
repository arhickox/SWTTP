                                <p class="card-text">Not everyone who is skilled in the ways of the Force seeks to hold a
                                        position of tremendous authority. In fact, some believe they would find it too easy
                                        to abuse their unique abilities if they placed themselves in a position of leadership.
                                        Instead, they choose to accept the Advisor’s role to ensure they cannot be corrupted
                                        by the lure of power. Others feel their advice too valuable to limit to one planet
                                        or region and wander the stars, sowing the guidance of the Force wherever they might
                                        go. Socially adept and Force-sensitive characters with either of these philosophies
                                        can be excellent fits for the Advisor specialization.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Their skill set enables Advisors to take a very pragmatic approach in
                                        working with others and offering them the guidance of the Force. An accomplished
                                        Advisor can quickly analyze the risks of a situation and then, using the necessary
                                        tools, influence the involved parties so that a desired outcome is rapidly achieved.
                                        A less scrupulous individual with these techniques could become a successful con
                                        artist. Advisors must be careful to avoid that fate.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Some Advisors attach themselves to a planetary government, helping to
                                        shape the rule of law and ensure fairness and justice for all. Many popular rulers
                                        have had wise Advisors at hand, helping ensure their policies do the most good for
                                        the greatest number. Other Advisors choose to work in less glamorous roles—often
                                        among the poor and the desperate. There, they try to counsel and guide individuals
                                        in dire straits, sometimes providing salvation to those who have lost all hope.</p>

                                                knowledge to help others avoid these traps. In some cases, they worked for
                                                casino owners and criminal bosses as spotters to find cheaters or as “coolers”
                                                to manipulate a table, making it harder for others to win. Pretty soon, even
                                                advising people of cons and cheating felt inadequate; it only emboldened
                                                more greed and gambling. These con artists went on to find other answers.

                                                constructive growth, these economists became frustrated at how a single individual
                                                could cause such misery. Peers told them that economics has no morality and

                                                Politics isn’t an unfeeling machine after all, but a web of people pushing
                                                and pulling toward their own desires. They pressed hands, spoke encouraging
                                                words, and made essential contacts. These political experts became adept
                                                at pulling strings, seeing them reverberate throughout the web. This webbing
