                                <p class="card-text">A Jedi Knight serves as warrior, diplomat, ambassador, and scholar, leading
                                        clone troopers to repel the droid army
                                        of the Confederacy of Independent
                                        Systems. In many ways, Knights act as
                                        the face and symbol of the Republic,
                                        more so than the clone troopers, and
                                        perhaps even more than the Senators and representatives in the Galactic Senate. While their
                                        numbers are few compared to the total population of
                                        the galaxy, the Jedi, as a whole, affect billions of lives.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Jedi Knights are guardians of peace and justice.
                                        Through acts of charity, assistance, teaching, and in
                                        some cases, fighting in another’s defense, the Jedi
                                        Knights serve the people of the Republic. When Jedi
                                        render aid and express compassion, this motivates
                                        others to do the same. The Force exists in all living
                                        beings, and the suffering of those beings affects the
                                        Force. In addition, Knights serve as the general public’s primary guide to the Force and as living examples
                                        of what one can accomplish by accepting the Force.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Knights must also serve with stoicism, to avoid letting their emotions overwhelm them. Even in times
                                        of peace, Knights regularly decide when Padawans,
                                        other Knights, and soldiers should risk their lives for
                                        a greater good. Fear of failure or death cannot cloud
                                        their judgment. Yet, Knights must take care not to fall
                                        into cold indifference, sacrificing lives as if they were
                                        mere numbers to be placed in a casualty report.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Taking on the role of a Jedi Knight means taking
                                        command of the troops, of the situation, and of one’s
                                        self. With a whole galaxy in turmoil, a Knight must
                                        combat the hesitation and confusion in themself and
                                        in others. The people need leadership, and Knights
                                        who doubt themselves cannot serve the people.</p>
