                                <p class="card-text">Out among the stars, engines screaming through the cockpit while he
                                        performs a maneuver that would send lesser beings into seizures or unconsciousness,
                                        the Pilot is truly himself. While the sheer joy of flying is often rewarding, most
                                        Pilots gain true satisfaction when they pit themselves and their machines against
                                        an aggressor force and duel it out in the blackness of space.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">In addition to being skilled at flying and knowing where to go, Pilots
                                        must also be exceedingly tough and trained to endure the harshest conditions if they
                                        are going to have the slightest chance of surviving when the worst happens.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">No one denies the special place Pilots have in a military organization,
                                        least of all the Pilots themselves. Most have at least a certain amount of cockiness
                                        (sometimes bordering on arrogance), which is to be expected when a person wraps a
                                        few tons of machinery around himself and hurls into the void of space to regularly
                                        risk instant vaporization. The average life expectancy of a typical Alliance starhghter
                                        Pilot engaged with Imperial forces is extremely low; only by being the very best
                                        does a Pilot stand a chance of survival or success.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Not surprisingly, true Pilots are considered a precious commodity in
                                        the Alliance. Commanders are often seen as being too cautious in deploying them;
                                        each mission is almost guaranteed to cost at least a few lives and a few machines.
                                        The Rebellion ultimately stands or falls on the capacity of its Pilots to face the
                                        overwhelming odds of the Empire's best and somehow be better.</p>

                                                light touch on the flight stick allows them to coax their chassis of choice
                                                into maneuvers never intended by its engineers. Former competitive Pilots
                                                are valued in the Rebellion and Empire alike as combat Aces, due to their

                                                and starship models than many other pilots have even flown. These Pilots
                                                know the actual stress limits on their vehicles, and just how far outside
                                                the safety margins they can be pushed. They also study the specifications
                                                of enemy craft, which means they often have a basic maneuvering game plan
                                                to beat any enemy combatant they encounter. Because of this, High Command
                                                often brings in test Pilots when developing new combat tactics to counter

                                                come in only three varieties: the brilliant, the lucky, and the dead. The
                                                fragile nature of the TIE fighter encourages Imperial swarm tactics, but
                                                those who survive more than a few sorties are either incredibly lucky or
                                                very skilled in maximizing the TIE fighter's speed and maneuverability advantage.
                                                Academy pilots who make it to the Rebellion often increase their survivability
                                                by a factor of ten, thanks to a Rebel preference for shielded fighters with

                                                The Rebels aren't common criminals; they can be trusted not to backstab the
                                                Pilot and are known to pay for their cargo on time with minimal funny business.
                                                Unfortunately, if Imperials catch wind of a smuggler supplying Rebels, the
                                                subsequent bounties attract a string of hunters. Because most of a smuggler's
                                                typical associates would sell them out in a Coruscant minute, smugglers are
                                                forced into working for the Rebels almost exclusively or joining them outright,
