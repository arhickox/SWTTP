                                <p class="card-text">The Empire trains cadets to be effective and unquestioning soldiers.
                                        To its dismay, some of its most promising students are not willing to blindly obey.
                                        For many of the former aspiring Imperial pilots, officers, and stormtroopers who
                                        have deserted after gaining firsthand exposure to the Empire’s practices, the Empire
                                        is an undeniable evil that must be opposed.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">To many individuals in these times, the Empire represents stability
                                        and order. It is responsible for having saved them from the Separatists and the traitorous
                                        Jedi Order. The Imperial military, specifically, offers opportunities to serve that
                                        body in addition to the promise of patriotic fulfillment, exploration, and power.
                                        For those who haven’t experienced the Empire’s oppression, these can be powerful
                                        motivators to join up. Many adventurous souls desiring to escape the inevitability
                                        of a life without excitement or advancement have looked to the Imperial academies
                                        as a way to venture into the wider galaxy. Depending on the academy, however, even
                                        getting accepted can be a highly competitive affair, in which only the most naturally
                                        talented candidates have a chance—unless, of course, a candidate’s family is connected.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Once a cadet is accepted, the glowing veneer of the Empire can begin
                                        to flake away. While cadets have the opportunity to gain knowledge in a variety of
                                        fields, the study of warfare is the most heavily emphasized. A select few are groomed
                                        to become pilots, but many only benefit from the combat training to become stormtroopers.
                                        During training, instructors often encourage and even reward peer sabotage in order
                                        to foster callous behavior and direct their charges’ loyalty only to the Empire.
                                        Despite this practice, unyielding cadets occasionally emerge who did not resort to
                                        such underhanded tactics and refused to be properly molded during training. When
                                        these cadets come to the attention of their instructors, however, it is not uncommon
                                        for them to suddenly vanish.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">For some who remain, knowing that their life will consist of following
                                        strict orders, regardless of the harm to peaceful civilians, quenches any desire
                                        to continue. After participating in theoretical or training operations to suppress
                                        unruly citizens, it becomes impossible for such cadets to ignore these operations
                                        in practice. For those who abandon the military but don’t rebel immediately, the
                                        continued abuse they witness can be more than enough to motivate them to join the
                                        resistance movement. A few rebel cells have been known to assist disillusioned cadets
                                        in their defections. After fleeing their academy, former cadets are able to see the
                                        transgressions they may not have noticed before joining.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Imperial Academy Cadets are effective agents against the Empire because
                                        their training helps them to anticipate and exploit the Imperials’ common tactics.
                                        Any mechanical blueprint a rogue cadet has been exposed to becomes a liability to
                                        the Empire. Any glimpsed prototypes lose their element of surprise, and any protocol
                                        learned can be exploited for covert missions. To disrupt the enemy, one most know
                                        the enemy, and these cadets know the Empire all too well.
