                                <p class="card-text">If there is one thing a Politico knows how to do better than anyone
                                        else in the galaxy, it's talking. He can talk to anyone about anything in any necessary
                                        way. What others accomplish with might and fear, a talented Politico may well achieve
                                        with a few well-placed words and a decent plan.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">A Politico might join a discussion, speech, or debate in any number
                                        of ways. With his talents, he might act to inspire greatness in those around him,
                                        or he might know just what to say to cut an opponent to the core, diminishing his
                                        confidence and leaving him vulnerable.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Politicos in the Outer Rim are usually up to something; ambition is
                                        hardwired into their very being. They may not yet know what they wish to accomplish,
                                        but when they see an opportunity to achieve some kind of greater goal, they will
                                        turn all their will and personality towards achieving it. Politicos might sign on
                                        to temporarily work for another, but they will not long be happy in a subservient
                                        role. Leadership is the core of who they are.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">In a group, the Politico works best as the front-man, or the "face."
                                        More than anyone, he is best suited for initial contacts with any being or group,
                                        and he's the best to have at any negotiation, social gathering, or interrogation.
                                        There are even times when he can bring up morale in combat and crisis situations,
                                        though the palace throne room, corporate board room, or casino floor tend to be better
                                        battlefields for him.</p>

                                                as a representative of a larger political or commercial interest. Many colonies
                                                are founded by established governments or corporations, and those governments
                                                and corporations tend to want to ensure the colony stays loyal and profitable.
                                                Thus, they often pack the colonial administration with their own appointees.
                                                These appointees may be receiving the task as a reward for loyalty or previous
                                                services rendered, or as the next step in a promising career. Generally,
                                                however, they are chosen from outside the colony they will be running. Most
                                                colonists react to these off-world administrators with suspicion and resentment,
                                                seeing them as outside overlords sent to keep them in line.</li>

                                                as a young and idealistic leader of a colony. In the past, he honestly believed
                                                he could build a new Utopia in this new world, free from the corruption and
                                                graft of established planets. Eventually, however, he saw his world succumb
                                                to the same problems he thought he left behind, leaving him with an embittered
                                                view of his situation.</li>

                                                they stood up for what they believed in, and that put them in opposition
                                                to the Empire. They may have used their status as a known public persona
                                                to spread a message of defiance. Now they're on the run, marked for arrest
                                                (or even execution) by the Imperial authorities. Since they may have been
                                                a prominent figure in their previous life, their defiance is even more galling

                                                A Politico may start life as a preacher for one of the galaxy's many faiths.
                                                He might be from the bantha-worshipping Dim-U monks, the trendy, female-empowering

                                                of the Ffib, or one of the chaste Priests of Ninn. Whatever his beliefs,
                                                however, he must serve as a shepherd for his flock, and often must deal with
                                                more secular problems than spiritual ones.</li>

                                                an unrelenting desire for justice across the galaxy, often find themselves
                                                in the Outer Rim seeking to bring attention to the problems that its inhabitants
                                                face—problems that the galaxy at large would often like to ignore or forget
                                                about. A Politico might approach members of an isolated mining town and urge

                                                Empire alike. Some might even openly stoke the fires of revolution, seeking
