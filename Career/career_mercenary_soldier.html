                                        weapons and gear trooper, the Mercenary Soldier is the warfare expert. An adept of
                                        both ranged combat and military tactics, he is a leader of warriors in combat and
                                        a deadly combatant himself.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">A Mercenary Soldier can be a true mental rock in critical situations.
                                        He is a deadly foe all on his own, and deadlier still if he has a force to lead in
                                        battle.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Mercenary Soldiers are the most likely to have come from prior service
                                        with a larger organization, and they almost certainly had at least a non-commissioned
                                        officer role with that force. They have a keen grasp of both tactics and strategy,
                                        though they will tend to focus more on the former as a matter of practicality and
                                        survival. Even in less formal situations, a Mercenary Soldier will tend to show a
                                        high degree of personal discipline and order.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">In a Player Character group, it will not be out of the question for
                                        a Mercenary Soldier to take charge, at least in situations where combat is likely.
                                        Though his leadership skills are not as comprehensive as other specializations, they
                                        are uniquely focused for combat.</p>

                                                very well. Many such characters started life as soldiers, fighting for a
                                                single cause or government. However, even a heroic and successful soldier
                                                can fall from grace. Perhaps the wars he fought ended and the character was
                                                unable to live in peace, or perhaps he fought with his superiors over their
                                                foolish decisions and was forced to leave.</li>

                                                and give orders, their skill with firearms, and their innate discipline make
                                                them natural leaders and commanders in a band of miscreants and soldiers

                                                betrayed by their superiors and left to die on some nameless battlefield.
                                                That betrayal might be why the Mercenary Soldier became a mercenary in the
                                                first place. In his new role, he has the motive and the weaponry to enact

                                                same position as the Marauder, but reversed. His parent could have been a
                                                renowned soldier, even a war hero. However, when he joined the military,
                                                the character found that he was ill-fit for the soldier's life. For his own
                                                reasons, he turned to mercenary work and became a Hired Gun. Although he
                                                uses the skills he learned as a soldier, he must come to terms with the disappointment
                                                of his parent (and possibly his own guilt as well).</li>

                                                the character with a lasting air of authority that defines his actions long
                                                after losing the badge. In addition, a former sheriff might keep a sense
