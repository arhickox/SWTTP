                                <p class="card-text">The presence and showmanship that can come naturally to all Mystics
                                        reflects itself in the way of a duelist. For practitioners of Makashi, dominating
                                        a combat through one’s presence is just as important as dominating it through martial
                                        prowess, and the Makashi Duelist is the ultimate expression of that art.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Makashi Duelist's skill set reflects the showmanship and presentation
                                        so intrinsic to the duelist’s art. A true Makashi Duelist must always fight with
                                        poise and grace, never showing the slightest strain and keeping complete control
                                        over his facial expressions and his body’s most minute movements.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Though some detractors may dismiss this fighting style as overly foppish
                                        and vain, a Makashi Duelist remains an exceptionally potent combatant. Those detractors
                                        forget that the Makashi form was developed to fight against other lightsaber-armed
                                        opponents. At its heart, Makashi focuses on one goal: to meet an enemy with a sword
                                        or lightsaber and slay him. A true Makashi Duelist never loses sight of this goal,
                                        and all his flourishes and feints are but means to an end. Movements that work to
                                        deflect and exhaust an opponent—particularly if the foe is not prepared for battle
                                        with a Force-sensitive—can soon leave an enemy frustrated with the entire experience.
                                        As the opponent becomes increasingly worn down, the Makashi Duelist soon finds an
                                        opportunity to exploit the foe’s exhaustion.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">A Makashi Duelist’s force of personality, rather than natural athleticism,
                                        often drives his combat technique. Elements of personal flair become an effective
                                        means of disorienting and distracting an opponent during a battle. Sometimes a verbal
                                        misdirection can be every bit as effective as a physical one, leaving an opponent
                                        open to a single master stroke.</p>

                                                did not start off studying combat or warfare. A number of them had an artistic
                                                bent, and being drawn to the fluid motions of the body, tended to be dancers.
                                                In their early studies, they moved their bodies to music, but that didn’t
                                                feel quite right. In an epiphany, they danced in silence and found a rhythm
                                                that had no sound and no touch, but still felt real. Over time, their dancing
                                                helped achieve a meditative state, merging mind and body with a tempo indescribable—the
                                                Force.

                                                so vague as to be worthless, a puzzle to provoke endless questions and doubt.
                                                Petitioners wandered off confused and often angry, yet the words would stick

                                                tested out strengths, performing small tricks to gauge gullibility and lying
                                                to buy time. When they saw an opportunity, they whittled down their opposition
                                                with blows or words—perfect Makashi Duelist technique.
