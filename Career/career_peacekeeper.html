                                        to suffer under their rule. Some Guardians take direct action through military force
                                        to attempt to overthrow such despots. Other Guardians see wars ravaging planets and
                                        harming the weak and defenseless. They step in to defend those innocents, and enforce
                                        peace at the tip of a lightsaber. These Guardians are often known as Peacekeepers.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Peacekeepers can recognize threats and respond to them in an effective
                                        and timely manner. Skilled Peacekeepers must be able to effectively delegate assignments
                                        to allies while reserving themselves to confront the challenges for which they are
                                        most adept.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Many Peacekeepers only assume this specialization after they have been
                                        thrust into a position of authority—sometimes repeatedly. Because of their naturally
                                        protective personalities, these Guardians want to do everything in their power to
                                        protect their friends. Often, they decide the best choice is to become the best leader
                                        they can, out of a sense of responsibility rather than a desire for power.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Characters who pursue the Peacekeeper’s path seldom limit their activities
                                        to a single region. Often once one region has been pacified or a tyrant overthrown,
                                        a Peacekeeper sets his sight on the next challenge and leads his friends and fellow
                                        freedom fighters to overcome it. Under the shadow of the Empire, Peacekeepers are
                                        always needed.</p>

                                                civilized society. Corrupt as the Empire may be, the fundamental mandate
                                                of law enforcement dates back to eras unremembered. The daily duties of one
                                                following that creed have much in common across the galaxy: preventing crime,
                                                resisting anarchy and chaos, and protecting the populace. Still, when unjust
                                                orders contravene the Peacekeeper’s principles, this PC might be forced to
                                                choose between upholding the letter of the law and defying it in the name
                                                of some greater calling.

                                                in a very public office in law enforcement or the military and thus learned
                                                to lead by example. This character has always set the tone for those nearby
                                                with a palpable aura of calm, order, and dedication. No stranger to the weight
                                                of public expectation, the character faces down enemies and allies alike
                                                with steadfast conviction. As a leader, the PC succeeded at some great task
                                                and earned recognition for it. Did the Peacekeeper gain an epiphany about
                                                the Force in the course of accomplishing an act of heroism, or was it in
                                                the anguish of failure that uncovered newfound determination and power?

                                                or emissary for a hostile syndicate or pirate crew, who worked to convince
                                                a group’s enemies to submit quietly rather than sparking all-out gang war.
                                                With a serious concern for life and the skills to stay alive in a fight,
                                                a Peacekeeper can be an ideal messenger for delivering bad news without starting
                                                a bloodbath. After all, criminal organizations benefit from peace as much
                                                as legal corporations do—even if this peace is maintained and enforced at
                                                great cost to the people.

                                                justice has to be done, regardless of who’s in charge. Heeding the call of
                                                the Force, this sort of character has followed the call of those in need.
                                                The Peacekeeper might have served as a wandering mediator, helping end local
                                                conflicts using an outside perspective and intuition. Over time, the Peacekeeper
                                                could have become a self-made hero who always departs from a place as soon
                                                the situation is resolved and others have greater need of aid. </li>
