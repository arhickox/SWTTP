                                <p class="card-text">For the Gunner, the output of a vehicle or ship weapon is the ultimate
                                        expression of projected power. He sees mastery of such weapons as a way for a single
                                        person to show the Empire what it means to fight for freedom and justice, and to
                                        do so to great effectiveness. He also sees his role as the defender of all who ride
                                        with him in whatever vehicle he's crewing.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Gunners are often faced with terrifying odds or unknown threats requiring
                                        nerves of steel. When their positions are overrun, hand-to-hand fighting is often
                                        the only choice they have. Larger blasters and similar ranged weapons are also often
                                        of interest to the Gunner.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Whether the Gunner is laying down a field of fire from the door of a
                                        transport ship in a hot landing zone or firing pinpoint volleys at a star cruiser's
                                        shield generators, he is more than comfortable with the idea of possessing large
                                        amounts of firepower. He knows the value of what he does, and the sheer thrill of
                                        unleashing so much devastation with each pull of the trigger is very satisfying.
                                        The resultant explosion of an enemy target is a payoff worth far more than any moment
                                        of glory.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Proficient Gunners are a true asset in the Alliance, and the best ones
                                        are usually assigned to the most important defensive posts, assault vehicles, and
                                        ships. In most battles with the Empire, every single shot counts. It's the Gunner's
                                        job to make sure it counts heavily and with great purpose.</p>

                                                Gunners used to working the racing and rodeo circuits are valued additions
                                                to the Rebellion. While their flying may only be average, their uncanny accuracy
                                                makes them at home in a dogfight. Their kill counts are among the highest,
                                                and there are no better Aces for disabling enemy vehicles, though their focus
                                                on attacking means they aren't as practiced at evasive maneuvers.</li>

                                                Gunners have an unerring ability to skirt the very edge of a weapon's heat

                                                and defensive fire patterns depending on the tactical situation. Gunners
                                                who move to the Alliance struggle with the lack of discipline, and often

                                                pirates, many of whom began life as captured merchants forced into a life
                                                of piracy under threat of enslavement. Pirate gunners are excellent sharpshooters,
