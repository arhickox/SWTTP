                        <div class="card-body">
                                <p class="card-text">The Figurehead is a particularly good choice for a character with a
                                        political background, or who has significant ties to the Alliance’s politicians and
                                        diplomats. Figureheads who formerly held no political ambitions are just as likely
                                        to take this specialization as are those who dabbled in politics prior to their stint
                                        in the Alliance.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">A character’s deeds before becoming a Figurehead might also shape that
                                        character’s future, as war heroes are occasionally used to boost morale among the
                                        rank-and-file troops. Likewise, sending one of the Rebellion’s greatest heroes to
                                        negotiate a treaty is a huge show of trust that can’t be beat.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Figureheads generally come from civilian backgrounds and aren’t necessarily
                                        a part of the Alliance Military’s chain of command. They rely on their reputations,
                                        political connections, and charisma to accomplish their goals. Though their aims
                                        might not align perfectly with those of the other Commander careers, the respect
                                        they command due to their political legacies ensures that they continue to be a motivating
                                        factor in both political and military circles within the Rebel Alliance. Examples
                                        of Figureheads in the Rebel Alliance include Mon Mothma and the late Bail Organa,
                                        as well as his adopted daughter, Princess Leia Organa.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Many Commanders focus their social aptitudes on skills that help them
                                        get people to do what they want, such as Coercion. Figureheads, on the other hand,
                                        get what they want through subtle manipulations, preferring to persuade those under
                                        their command to do what must be done.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Much of a Figurehead’s repertoire consists of personal fortitude, as
                                        bearing the hopes and fears of their people is a Figurehead’s primary focus. Cool
                                        is especially important, for it allows a Figurehead to gain the trust and admiration
                                        of subordinates. Figureheads’ demeanor must inspire those who admire them, allowing
                                        their followers to overcome their personal qualms—including fear—in order to strike
                                        a blow against the Galactic Empire. Whether this inspiring quality applies to a Figurehead’s
                                        physical appearance depends on the character’s personal style; many Figureheads have
                                        turned their scars and the wounds they’ve suffered into inspirational messages all
                                        their own.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Figureheads who take a more active role in resisting the Empire’s oppression
                                        often do so through leadership and inspiration. The confidence and know-how of a
                                        trained leader is much more convincing under fire than good looks and a pithy slogan.
                                        Seeing action in combat also serves to bolster a Figurehead’s reputation within the
                                        military, as Figureheads not only know how to "talk the talk,” but to “walk the walk”
                                        as well.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">As many Figureheads got their start in the political arenas of the Core
                                        Worlds, it’s no surprise that most of them know a thing or two about where they’ve
                                        come from. Not only do they have extensive knowledge of Core World political systems—including
                                        those of the now-defunct Republic—but they also have information about which Core
                                        Worlds systems are more or less opposed to the Empire. Such information can be valuable
                                        when deciding which systems to approach for help or determining where a group of
                                        Rebels in a pinch might be able to seek refuge.</p>

                                                Pal- patine came to power. These Figureheads soon found themselves left out
                                                in the cold, their opinions and politics openly ignored or violently prosecuted
                                                by their former master. Some come from the Senate, having formerly represented
                                                a system or locality, while others held more mundane positions within the
                                                Republic or Imperial political machines. Whatever their reasons, they see
                                                a promise of power in the Rebel Alliance—if it can win the war, of course.</li>

                                        <li><b class="bold-gold">Citizen Soldier: </b>Though politics may be a realm of power
                                                and ambition, a great many politicos get involved in the affairs of state
                                                to better serve their communities. Though some of these officeholders may
                                                have been successful in local politics, or even risen to occupy a Senator’s
                                                seat, the Empire has effectively stripped their people of freedom, and nothing
                                                they can do through official channels can change that. With the trust and
                                                admiration of their constituents behind them, these Figureheads take their
                                                talents to the Rebel Alliance, motivating citizens the galaxy over to support
                                                the fight against Imperial tyranny.</li>

                                                two different backgrounds. In the first, they once experienced a monumental
                                                climb in popularity and power, only to lose it all due to the Empire’s policies
                                                or their own overreach or corruption. In the second background, they never
                                                really succeeded as a politician at all, and instead eked out a living as
                                                a cog in some larger political machine. In these cases, they must attempt
                                                to either regain what they’ve lost, or gain what they never had, and the
                                                Rebel Alliance is the perfect opportunity to do just that.</li>
