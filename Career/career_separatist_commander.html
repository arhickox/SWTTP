                                <p class="card-text">Due to the Separatists’ hodgepodge nature,
                                        their commanders come from all walks
                                        of life. Rebels or patriots, fueled more by
                                        passion or ambition than experience, can
                                        rise in the ranks through undisciplined
                                        but daring tactical decisions. Corporate soldiers, having led squads against
                                        pirates, have the discipline, but credits
                                        might motivate them more than
                                        alty. Military commanders from a
                                        planetary militia or even ranking
                                        members of a civilian police force
                                        could find a position in the Separatist army, yet they have not
                                        seen battle on this scale before.
                                        </p>
                                <p class="card-text">These shortcomings do
                                        plague the CIS, but unique
                                        backgrounds can be, an
                                        advantage against the slow,
                                        traditionalist Republic. The
                                        Galactic Senate still has
                                        varying levels of dedication
                                        to the war, whereas the CIS
                                        military has the full backing
                                        of the Separatist government.
                                        Enthusiasm and support goes a
                                        long way toward giving its soldiers
                                        the strength to go on. The Clone
                                        Wars offer plenty of opportunities to gain experience, provided
                                        they survive the first few sorties.

                                <p class="card-text">The Separatist Commander
                                        specialization includes not
                                        only organic species but also
                                        droids given command responsibilities. In addition to Baktoid
                                        Combat Automata’s standardized T-series tactical droids and
                                        more advanced super tactical
                                        droids, the CIS uses whatever
                                        and whoever they can. A droid
                                        with a penchant for command and
                                        a steady success rate may engender
                                        more trust than an untested organic. In some cases, the Separatists
                                        have no choice. Given the holes
                                        in the command structure, an
                                        independent droid can mean the
                                        difference between victory and
                                        defeat, or between a high casualty rate and minimal losses.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">As a result of its lack of high-level military
                                        experience, the Confederacy of Independent
                                        Systems relies heavily on command battle
                                        droids and tactical droids to fill in their command ranks. Meanwhile, the Separatists
                                        utilize training systems from corporate military
                                        programs, small-scale urban riot police procedures, and squad-level professional bounty
                                        hunter drills to prepare organic commanders
                                        for their new responsibilities in the field.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">A Separatist commander must serve
                                        multiple roles, commanding fleets,
                                        troops, and tactical squads and coordinating surgical strikes while dealing
                                        with logistics and Separatist politics.
                                        The CIS still doesn’t approach the
                                        Republic’s level of organization.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">At the beginning of the conflict,
                                        sectors pulled troops from local armies, amateur militias,
                                        and even mercenary groups; not only
                                        did these officers make do with
                                        patchwork training, but they also
                                        had to contend with patchwork
                                        armies. This forced Separatist
                                        Commanders to be innovative in
                                        their strategies and tactics, using
                                        their non-standard militaries to
                                        outwit the stolid methods of the
                                        Republic forces. With the Techno
                                        Union’s and Trade Federation’s
                                        industries running at full speed,
                                        the core Separatist military has
                                        been augmented with innovative
                                        weapons such as the Hyena-class
                                        droid bomber and the Baktoid
                                        Armor Workshop super tank, and
                                        contracted designs such as the
                                        Droch-class boarding ship. Technology alone cannot win the day, but a
                                        technological surprise, when utilized
                                        effectively, can turn the tide toward
                                        victory. As such, Separatist Commanders must be able to adapt not
                                        only to their enemies, but also to
                                        their own armies.</p>
