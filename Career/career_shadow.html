                                <p class="card-text">In the ancient days of the Jedi Order, Sentinels worked tirelessly to
                                        police the galaxy’s criminal underbelly. Flowever, a small subset of these enforcers
                                        focused their attentions on a far greater and more dangerous threat. They trained
                                        tirelessly to find and eliminate those who had fallen to the dark side of the Force
                                        and willingly embraced corruption. These Sentinels were called Shadows, and they
                                        hunted the Sith.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">For many years, the Sith were thought destroyed, and the Jedi Shadows
                                        gave up their calling or pursued other dark side Force users. They never realized
                                        that the Sith had not been eliminated, and were hiding right under their noses.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Now, with the Jedi Order destroyed and a Dark Lord of the Sith ruling
                                        the Galactic Empire, those who would follow the path of the Shadow find their roles
                                        reversed. No longer the secret investigators of an established order who searched
                                        the shadows of civilization, they are now the ones who must stay hidden. Flowever,
                                        within these dark corners, Shadows still work tirelessly to bring justice to untouchable
                                        criminals and dark side Force users alike.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">These characters recognize that stealth and deception are integral to
                                        finding the targets they hunt. Criminal organizations are often mired in secrecy,
                                        and uncovering these secrets requires underhanded methods. While their techniques
                                        are frequently of questionable moral character, Shadows firmly believe their ultimate
                                        accomplishments more than justify the tools that they must use.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Of course, an initiate who has turned to the dark side can prove a powerful
                                        opponent for a Shadow. Working against such an adversary can require all of an adept’s
                                        mundane and Force talents. A Shadow’s willingness to examine and utilize every tool
                                        and asset can play a major factor in overcoming such capable foes.</p>

                                                forms to bolster the status quo, a mix of reactionaries and political conservatives.
                                                A Shadow discovers agents of the dark side manipulating the countermovement
                                                into increasing corruption, abuse of power, and violence. This character
                                                walks the Jedi path by first detecting, then defeating these insidious agents,

                                                such artifacts and agents. A desire for justice burns where the lust for

                                                to neutralize. They tend to be either extremely righteous, to the point of
                                                fanaticism, or steeped in moral ambiguity. Their gangs may share their moralities,
                                                but most don’t, following these Shadows only because such leaders are strong
                                                and effective. These leaders might break away from their gang when some of

                                                hatred. Due to a variety of inequalities, those communities have had good
                                                reason to feel these negative emotions. Protests, strikes, and walkouts don’t
                                                occur because laborers are happy. The hatred means agents of the dark side
                                                can come from within the community, not just from its oppressors, pushing

                                                judge their communities’ hatred in order to save them, they embrace their

                                                pulling the strings, corrupting souls, laws, and public confidence. These
