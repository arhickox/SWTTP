                                <p class="card-text">In a war, the vast majority of those who fight use weapons, explosives,
                                        and other tools of violence and destruction to confront the enemy. There are warriors,
                                        however, who do battle with codes, data packets, lightning-quick programming skills,
                                        and intuitive rewiring of communication networks to unmake the enemy's plans and
                                        reduce his technology to just so much useless metal, plastic, and wires. These tech
                                        warriors are called Slicers.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Computers and electronic systems are the battlefield of the typical
                                        Slicer, but he is also skilled at the arts of breaking and entering and other covert
                                        actions. Most Slicers also know their way around the streets and the criminal world,
                                        even when they are working legitimately for a military, government, or corporate
                                        organization.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">There is a feeling of community where Slicers are concerned, even among
                                        those who are directly opposed to one another. They know they operate at a different
                                        level from everyone else, understanding technology in a way the vast majority of
                                        the galaxy's population never will.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">For the Slicer, the secrets of banking, security, communications, droids,
                                        automated systems, vehicles, ships, and everything else involving a computer are
                                        his to manipulate or take. Any Slicer might be a minor god of a given system of networked
                                        machines but for the interference and opposition of other Slicers. Recognizing that
                                        only those of their kind can hope to challenge them gives most Slicers a sense of
                                        superiority, or at least a smug security in their value to those without such skills.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Those Slicers working for the Rebellion are often more altruistic than
                                        their compatriots elsewhere in the galaxy, though more than a few are with the Alliance
                                        simply because they need protection from the Empire and its allied corporations.
                                        Most Slicers work directly with Alliance Intelligence, but there are those adventurous
                                        types who prefer to be part of special teams sent into the heart of areas under Imperial
                                        influence. There, they can do battle directly with their counterparts, proving their
                                        superiority while serving the cause.</p>
