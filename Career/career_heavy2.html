                                <p class="card-text">The Empire marches to war with massive machines of death, designed not
                                        only to crush their foes but also any hopes of victory they might represent. The
                                        Rebel Alliance, for its part, is short on such materiel. While its starfighters and
                                        capital ships are able to directly contend with those of the Empire, the Rebel Alliance
                                        must fight most of its ground battles with infantry, supported only by entrenchments
                                        and light airspeeders. Many of its operations rely entirely on infantry. To this
                                        end, it must have troopers whose expertise and equipment allow them to take down
                                        even the most heavily armored targets. Heavies are the Soldiers best suited to carrying
                                        and operating these crucial big guns.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Resilience gives a Heavy the capacity to march considerable distances
                                        carrying a heavy blaster or missile tube, while Perception lets a Heavy find the
                                        gaps in the armor of enemy vehicles and fortifica tions to target once the battle
                                        begins. Gunnery and Ranged (Heavy) have more obvious applications, and make the Heavy
                                        one of the best Soldier specializations for shredding enemy formations and vehicles
                                        from afar. A Heavy should ideally have a solid starting Brawn characteristic in addition
                                        to a high Agility characteristic, so that the character can effectively wield cumbersome
                                        weapons.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Heavies tend to prefer direct solutions to their problems. After all,
                                        enough ordnance can reduce most any challenge to a smoldering crater, regardless
                                        of what it was before. Still, Heavies who fight on the battlefields of the Galactic
                                        Civil War must often be cunning and knowledgeable, too. While a Heavy working as
                                        a mercenary among smugglers or pirates is often the largest combatant on the field,
                                        a Heavy on the front lines is no match for a behemoth like an Imperial AT-AT in a
                                        straight-up fight. Defeating a massive walker requires not only the firepower to
                                        pierce its armored hull, but also the knowledge of its blind spots and the cleverness
                                        to exploit them. A veteran Heavy has almost assuredly gotten good at engaging and
                                        even beating vehicles and other craft that most ground troops would dismiss as invincible.
                                        Heavies are also extremely effective against infantry, and a single Heavy with a
                                        large gun and a good position can easily turn the tide of a battle.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Within a group of Player Characters, a Heavy is likely to be one of
                                        the strongest, toughest, and most lethal at range. Given the specialization’s destructive
                                        abilities, a Heavy is usually more at home on the battlefield than out spreading
                                        the word of the Rebellion or at clandestine meetings to rally supporters. Still,
                                        a Heavy can be a real asset to any party on and off the battlefield. The ability
                                        to both see and enact direct solutions is useful in nearly any context, and the Heavy’s
                                        skills and talents support this theme only slightly less fervently than the specialization’s
                                        capacity for wreaking vast and terrible destruction with gigantic firearms.</p>

                                                intensely physical and repetitive activity. The work may have been monotonous,
                                                but it built thick, powerful muscles capable of handling the largest heavy

                                                A defecting Imperial Heavy might have once served in the Stormtrooper Corps,
                                                been a promising cadet on Carida, or joined the Imperial Army as a volunteer
                                                or conscript. Heavies often gain the trust of their new squads quickly, after
                                                a few heavy weapon barrages cover an ally’s retreat.</li>

                                                used to being priority targets and are cool under fire. They typically specialize

                                                it, often going so far as to name their weapon. The Alliance values mercenary

                                                Clone Wars were typically militia members of wealthy worlds that could afford
                                                to outfit their combatants with expensive heavy weaponry. However, it is
                                                rare to find Soldiers from this era still fit enough to lug around a heavy
                                                repeating blaster. As a result, most deploy on a mobile emplacement alongside
                                                younger Soldiers. The veterans can pass down their hard-won experience while
