                                        Republic and Separatist Alliance fulfill similar
                                        duties. The Separatist Parliament even mimics
                                        the structure of the Galactic Senate, where most
                                        members previously served. Senators on both
                                        sides have responsibility on their shoulders
                                        representing not only their homeworlds, but
                                        also their constituents and their respective governments as a whole. These
                                        responsibilities often conflict and contradict, even as these politicians face
                                        the danger of a fractured government and a relentless enemy.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Republic Senate
                                        has tens of thousands of
                                        members representing
                                        homeworlds, guilds, federations, and corporate
                                        interests. This tends to
                                        drown out single voices, so
                                        Senators form coalitions and special
                                        interest groups to wield collective power.
                                        These Senates-in-miniature aim for specific goals, forming and disbanding as
                                        needed. For an average citizen, however,
                                        these political bodies often appear to do
                                        nothing more than selfish politicking.
                                        </p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Separatist Parliament numbers
                                        in the thousands, but its smaller size
                                        gives the illusion of direct democracy.
                                        Many Senators merely follow their
                                        charismatic leader, Count Dooku.
                                        Others, alarmed at Republic aggression, follow in step. A few Senators
                                        see this as a troubling trend, risking
                                        the same sort of corruption they saw
                                        in the Galactic Senate.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">A good Senator keeps in touch
                                        with their constituentsâ€”or at least
                                        gives this appearance of doing so.
                                        They rely on their representatives
                                        to inform them of polls, changes in
                                        attitude, and potential problems. In
                                        ' many ways, a Senator acts as commander of a squad of diplomats
                                        and support staff on a mission
                                        to advance their homeworld or
                                        corporate entity politically, economically, or militarily.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Most Senators have received
                                        the best education available on
                                        their homeworld and have mastered the full breadth of rhetorical
                                        tactics. A successful Senator knows
                                        how to relate to their constituents
                                        and fellow politicians, when to lay
                                        the facts on the table, and when to
                                        obfuscate the truth.
                                        </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Though many Senators in both
                                        governments spend the majority
                                        of their time in their respective
                                        Senates, some prefer a hands-on
                                        approach. After all, seeing disparity, atrocity, or disenfranchisement
                                        with their own eyes can make
                                        a problem more real and make
                                        arguments more impassioned.
                                        I By traveling to affected worlds, a
                                        Senator can get more work done
                                        by personally organizing locals,
                                        investigating cover-ups, and gathering evidence. When a corrupt
                                        Senator is themself the cause
                                        of inequity, sometimes catching
                                        the criminal requires another
                                        Senator. In this case, the actions
                                        taken are closer to spy work, as
                                        the investigating Senator uses
                                        their guile, silver tongue, and
                                        status to lead the criminal into
                                        a trap and toward justice.</p>
