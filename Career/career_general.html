                                        Force helps them see the bigger
                                        picture and understand the larger
                                        objectives in war. Their practice controlling their fear and anger provides
                                        a powerful benefit on the battlefield.
                                        While the Jedi Council debates the
                                        Jedi’s role in the war, certain Jedi
                                        step up to take on leadership positions that the Grand Army of the
                                        Republic sorely needs. The histories of the Jedi Order
                                        piw and Galactic Republic are inseparable. The Jedi have always been on
                                        the forefront of conflicts and wars,
                                        though not leading armies. The Clone
                                        Wars have changed this relationship, but
                                        a relative few Jedi truly embody the role of
                                        General.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Jedi Generals deal with mundane
                                        administrative decisions regarding
                                        staffing, equipment and resupply, promotions and training, and even budget
                                        requests. They also differ from many
                                        strategic officers by taking to the
                                        field of battle alongside their troops.
                                        These Jedi f’nd their senses more
                                        acute on the field than when watching
                                        troop movements on a holoprojector.
                                        They understand the cost of wai: the
                                        destruction, the death, and the fear
                                        that the troops must endure.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The war puts the Jedi in a unique position. As an
                                        independent body that serves the Republic, the Jedi
                                        can make decisions for the good of the Republic while
                                        sometimes acting against the decisions of the government, even those of the Supreme Chancellor himself.
                                        The Jedi’s true purpose in commanding the clone army
                                        is not just to defend the Republic, but also to maintain
                                        the ethical standard it represents.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Jedi Generals must protect the lives of civilians first,
                                        the welfare of the Republic second, and the lives of their
                                        fellow soldiers last. They sometimes take on important
                                        missions themselves rather than saddling others with
                                        particularly weighty responsibilities. When a situation
                                        requires a calculated sacrifice of soldiers’ safety, it is
                                        doubly important that Jedi fight on the field. The Jedi
                                        cannot risk the lives of others while protecting their own.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The danger of this path lies in the possibility that
                                        Jedi Generals will forget their ultimate goal: peace.
                                        Jedi Generals must remember that they serve not only
                                        the Republic, but their Jedi Code and the galaxy as
                                        a whole. They have a responsibility to protect planets
                                        and their peoples even as they lead armies to occupy
                                        them. The thrill of victory and the rush of adrenaline
                                        can cloud the mind of even the most dedicated of Jedi.
                                        Victory cannot be the only goal.</p>
