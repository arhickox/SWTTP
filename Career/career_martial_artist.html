                                <p class="card-text">From the Kage Warriors of Quarzite to the enforcers of Black Sun,
                                        organizations and cultures across
                                        the galaxy have developed their own unique hand-to-hand combat styles to use
                                        their species’ physiology
                                        to greatest effect. Over decades, centuries, and millennia, these combat forms
                                        become more than mere
                                        means of inflicting violence; generations of practitioners work to make them
                                        into art forms, philosophies,
                                        and ways of life. A desire to practice self-defense can
                                        become a belief in the value of self-betterment and
                                        the innate potential of others, though not all ideologies develop along such
                                        lines. More than a few Bounty
                                        Hunters have picked up techniques from martial arts
                                        styles across the galaxy to help in their hunts. Some
                                        are shining examples of their school’s philosophies
                                        and traditions, but others are disgraced students, or
                                        have never even trained formally, earning their skills
                                        through hard experience on the battlefield.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">A Martial Artist benefits first and foremost from a
                                        high Brawn rating to empower the Brawl skill. However, Willpower is an extremely
                                        useful secondary
                                        characteristic, as it not only gives the Martial Artist
                                        the higher strain threshold needed to activate the
                                        specialization’s many talents that use strain as a
                                        resource, but also the ability to face intimidating foes
                                        up close without flinching. Further, talents like Mind
                                        Over Matter benefit from a higher Willpower, and let
                                        the Martial Artist fight even longer without becoming
                                        exhausted. Finally, the Martial Artist benefits greatly
                                        from investing in the Coordination skill, as talents like
                                        Martial Grace and Coordination Dodge let the Martial Artist supplement raw
                                        strength with finesse both
                                        offensively and defensively.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Unlike characters from most other specializations
                                        built around close-quarters combat, Martial Artists
                                        does not need a weapon to fight competently. Martial
                                        Artists generally value precision over brute strength, and strive to execute
                                        efficient unarmed
                                        strikes. By wasting as little energy as possible, they can deliver extremely
                                        forceful
                                        blows even when unarmed. This is reflected
                                        in talents like Precision Strike, which lets Martial Artists exhaust and weaken
                                        foes as they
                                        see fit rather than by chance. Martial Artists
                                        also seek to leverage their enemies’ strength
                                        against them in battle with talents like Overbalance, which allows them to throw
                                        foes off-balance after they attack. Martial Artists also have
                                        access to Parry to mitigate damage, and can
                                        even use Parry when unarmed.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">This unique combination of precise offense
                                        and controlled defense allows Martial Artists to
                                        contend with some of the toughest fighters in the
                                        galaxy. Of course, not every battle is worth fighting, and a trained Martial
                                        Artist knows to assess
                                        not only the enemy but also the situation before
                                        deciding whether to join the fray. Many schools
                                        of martial arts teach the idea that fights are
                                        to be avoided, and that the ideal way to
                                        win a battle is to avoid having it in the
                                        first place. Unsurprisingly, this attitude
                                        is less prevalent amongst Bounty
                                        Hunters who wield martial arts,
                                        as their profession demands a
                                        certain amount of violence, but
                                        some still apply these overarching principles to a certain degree.</p>

                                                than by fancy gadgets or fast ships. Their outlay for
                                                weapons, armor, ships, and high-tech gear is the lowest among their peers. It is not the pursuit of gear, or
                                                even money for its own sake that drives these individuals to chase the credits, but simple necessity; among

                                                job often reads like a medical dictionary. Martial Artists can easily spend tens of thousands of credits in
                                                medpacs and stimpacks, bacta and physical therapy,
                                                long hospital stays, surgeries, even cybernetic replacements. Good medical care is eye-wateringly expensive,
                                                and no one knows that better than Martial Artists.
