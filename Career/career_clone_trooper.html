                                <p class="card-text">Standard infantry make up the largest portion of the
                                        soldiers in almost every army. Their units handle the
                                        direct, personal conflict on the surface of every battlefield, whether that battlefield is on the ground, under
                                        the sea, or within the confines of a space station.
                                        Because the Clone Troopers—the infantry—represent
                                        the front line of the Grand Army of the Republic, their
                                        basic level of competency defines the army’s capabilities. In order for the army to be able to overcome its
                                        foes quickly and effectively, every Clone Trooper must
                                        be more capable than the rank and file of the Separatists’ droid armies.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">This specialization provides a versatile set of skills
                                        that are valuable to every Clone Soldier. A background as a member of the infantry provides a Clone
                                        Officer with a better understanding of the soldiers
                                        he commands. Similarly, infantry experience gives a
                                        Clone Pilot some familiarity with the risks faced by
                                        soldiers on the ground, which is useful for providing
                                        air support or extraction.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Clone Trooper specialization encompasses a
                                        range of more specific roles. Some of these are devoted to particular environmental conditions, including
                                        the combat roles of cold assault trooper, SCUBA
                                        trooper, and Galactic Marine. Other Clone Troopers,
                                        including paratroopers, flame troopers, and medics,
                                        have more extensive training to work with particular
                                        equipment. Soldiers who exhibit particular skills in
                                        service might be selected for advanced training within
                                        that skill set, including ARC troopers, scout troopers, and special ops clone troopers. While distinctive
                                        equipment characterizes each of these different combat and support roles, the training to use that gear
                                        and work under extreme situations is also critical to
                                        success within these niches.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Even within a unit, soldiers assume particular
                                        responsibilities. Often, one trooper is assigned to carry a heavier weapon—such as the Z-6 rotary blaster
                                        cannon—while others might wield alternative tools,
                                        such as explosives, communications gear, a medpac, or other equipment necessary to complete the
                                        mission at hand. Typically, Clone Troopers receive
                                        particular training to make use of any non-standard
                                        equipment they carry. However, Clone Troopers with
                                        less specialized training might redistribute such gear
                                        over the course of a mission.</p>

                                                distinct identities. Unique acts of heroism, unusual interests, or novel insights and discoveries all
                                                offer ways to set a particular clone apart from his

                                                might face overwhelming odds, encounter a generous bribe, or even have to turn their back on a

                                                their sacrifice may be necessary to secure a victory for the Republic. These soldiers are willing to

                                                try to take it further: to be the first to the objective, destroy the most droids in a skirmish, or
