                                <p class="card-text">A lightsaber is a potent weapon. When wielded forcefully, it can even
                                        overpower an opponent who has a weapon capable of parrying it. Further, its ability
                                        to deflect blaster bolts can make it an effective ranged weapon as well. Those who
                                        consider themselves Shien Experts—masters of the Shien lightsaber form—embrace the
                                        seeming contradiction between those two uses. They know that true lightsaber masters
                                        must possess the cunning to use such weapons to their full potential. It takes clever
                                        precision to reflect a ranged attack back toward an adversary, but just as much shrewd
                                        brilliance to recognize the right time to overpower adversaries through raw force.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">In order to effectively follow this path, a character needs to be flexible
                                        and to recognize the best approaches for different types of physical conflicts. Resilience
                                        and Athletics are critical tools for engaging in and enduring a prolonged battle,
                                        while Skulduggery enables the character to case out and prepare possible combat locations
                                        ahead of time to exploit the environment against an opponent.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Whenever possible, a Shien Expert prepares a battleground well in advance
                                        of a conflict. Often, these individuals take the time to study a range of different
                                        locations soon after they arrive in a city. Once combat begins, they can carefully
                                        exploit the environment and trigger any traps they may have prepared to unleash upon
                                        their opponents.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">During combat, Shien Experts continue to constantly analyze the situation.
                                        While they take advantage of the terrain throughout a battle, they are also selective
                                        in choosing the best way to use their training as well as their lightsaber. This
                                        can change with each passing instant, in reaction to the armament, position, and
                                        stance of their enemies. For these individuals, an extended conflict is a sure route
                                        to victory as they react to every move their opponents make with a clever counter
                                        or powerful strike.</p>
