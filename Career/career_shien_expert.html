                                <p class="card-text">A lightsaber is a potent weapon. When wielded forcefully, it can even
                                        overpower an opponent who has a weapon capable of parrying it. Further, its ability
                                        to deflect blaster bolts can make it an effective ranged weapon as well. Those who
                                        consider themselves Shien Experts—masters of the Shien lightsaber form—embrace the
                                        seeming contradiction between those two uses. They know that true lightsaber masters
                                        must possess the cunning to use such weapons to their full potential. It takes clever
                                        precision to reflect a ranged attack back toward an adversary, but just as much shrewd
                                        brilliance to recognize the right time to overpower adversaries through raw force.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">In order to effectively follow this path, a character needs to be flexible
                                        and to recognize the best approaches for different types of physical conflicts. Resilience
                                        and Athletics are critical tools for engaging in and enduring a prolonged battle,
                                        while Skulduggery enables the character to case out and prepare possible combat locations
                                        ahead of time to exploit the environment against an opponent.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Whenever possible, a Shien Expert prepares a battleground well in advance
                                        of a conflict. Often, these individuals take the time to study a range of different
                                        locations soon after they arrive in a city. Once combat begins, they can carefully
                                        exploit the environment and trigger any traps they may have prepared to unleash upon
                                        their opponents.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">During combat, Shien Experts continue to constantly analyze the situation.
                                        While they take advantage of the terrain throughout a battle, they are also selective
                                        in choosing the best way to use their training as well as their lightsaber. This
                                        can change with each passing instant, in reaction to the armament, position, and
                                        stance of their enemies. For these individuals, an extended conflict is a sure route
                                        to victory as they react to every move their opponents make with a clever counter
                                        or powerful strike.</p>

                                                with lateral thinking and unusual methods. For example, a city might lower
                                                the tax on goods sold in much larger quantities, rewarding larger, possibly
                                                more government-friendly merchant groups and effectively punishing smaller
                                                sellers. The activist instead arranges collective bulk purchasing for many
                                                small-scale merchants, thereby allowing them to continue to compete fairly
                                                with the larger organizations. Alternatively, when a city shuts down the
                                                flow of public water to drive out the poorer citizens, the budding Shien

                                                and oppressive systems lengthwise, undercutting their effectiveness, and
                                                then breaking them with raw force, the activist unwittingly mimics the Jedi
                                                Order’s Shien training by using cunning to deal with a conflict in an unorthodox

                                                soft power provides many more opportunities to overwhelm an opponent. These
                                                leaders run their gangs via intimidation; verbal confrontations are common,
                                                and their gangs often revel in mystery, symbolism, and reputation. For example,
                                                instead of beating up a rival, a gang might leave something personal on the

                                                off identifying a dysfunctional system. Being a laborer working as a cog
                                                in a machine offers a special kind of perspective on systems. Shien Experts
                                                know that sometimes all it takes is a tiny bit of sand in a gear to cause
                                                things to come a grinding halt. Immediately perceiving a problem person or
                                                even a broken physical system, such as a factory’s manufacturing line, Shien
                                                Experts seek out ways to fix or patch the flaw. Once they have fixed that
                                                system, the Shien Experts move on to new flaws and weaknesses elsewhere:

                                                takeover mirrors the language and tactics of warfare. Diplomacy becomes contract
                                                negotiations; cutting off supply lines is similar to buying out or bankrupting

                                                experience of struggling in a position of weakness. This is a classic case
                                                of asymmetrical warfare, with no resources, a demoralized people, no weapons,

                                                and a lack of communication (or outright antirefugee propaganda). The opponents
                                                being faced are the unfair laws, prejudices, and lack of support of the host
                                                planet. When the Shien Expert leaves the refugee camp, whether triumphant
