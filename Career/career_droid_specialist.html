                                <p class="card-text">Like battlefield surgeons working on organic soldiers, Alliance Droid
                                        Specialists focus on making their charges functional for combat but often must sacrifice
                                        perfection for practicality. A Core World droid factory may have the luxury to produce
                                        repairs that return a damaged droid to a like-new state. In the midst of horrific
                                        combat or in repair bays lacking proper resources, though, Droid Specialists can’t
                                        be fancy. When faced with dozens of droids, having to stop and reassess a custom
                                        configuration not only slows the repair work, it complicates the job. At the end
                                        of the day, if their mechanical comrades are fit for another day of support and battle,
                                        then their mission is accomplished.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Droids serve two purposes in the Alliance: to assist their organic counterparts
                                        and to integrate with computers and other data storage devices. Some Droid Specialists
                                        see themselves like the sergeants of a droid platoon, treating their inorganic soldiers
                                        harshly but fairly, sending them out into battle without hesitation, and working
                                        hard to ensure the droids have the programming and technology they need to come back.
                                        Others have a colder practicality. Repairing a damaged droid takes less time and
                                        resources than replacing or building a new one.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">The topic of droid manumission remains a messy one. Various bases treat
                                        droids differently depending on their commander’s attitude, the soldiers’ attitudes,
                                        their morale, and the circumstances. Regardless, Droid Specialists tend to be protective
                                        of their inorganic soldiers. Whether it is because they recognize them as sentient
                                        beings or as valuable machines depends on the individual. The Alliance as a whole
                                        treats droids with more consideration and respect than the rest of the galaxy. Droid
                                        Specialists advocating on their behalf have contributed to this positive change.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Although the Rebellion receives equipment en masse, Droid Specialists
                                        can’t count on consistency or quality. As supply lines and alliances change, so do
                                        their sources of parts and droids. As a result, Alliance droids tend to take on a
                                        patchwork look much like that of their Outer Rim counterparts. Rebel agents can often
                                        tell how well a base is supplied just by the droids: if they look clean and relatively
                                        uniform, the base is obviously well supplied. If the droids appear completely different
                                        from each other (and have personality quirks to rival a rogue Outer Rim droid), then
                                        the agent knows the base is in dire shape.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">This is the difficulty most Droid Specialists face in Rebel outposts
                                        without a regular supply line. Organics tend to get the most supplies, followed by
                                        the machines of war: blasters, cannons, and starfighters. At the bottom of the ladder
                                        stand the droids, which must bear the brunt of rationed supplies while functioning
                                        to serve their organic commanders. Some Droid Specialists see this work as a punishment.
                                        Others come to identify with their charges. Droid Specialists often see their quartermaster
                                        as their greatest nemesis, the Empire being a close second.

                                                come straight from industry R&D labs. They are often responsible for droid
                                                brain design and construction and are experts in droid behavior. Others,
                                                professors who have taught the theories behind droid design, come from universities.
                                                Thanks to their experience, many have rejected the Empire’s callous treatment
                                                of droids. Countless droid designers and Engineers have resigned their positions
                                                in protest or disgust, and have found a home caring for the many droids that
