                                <p class="card-text">Adherents of the Guardian career are driven by a strong sense of responsibility
                                        and compassion. They recognize their affinity for the Force gives them the power—and
                                        responsibility—to help the helpless and aid the oppressed. Guardians tend to be blunt
                                        and forthright, using their prodigious combat prowess and natural leadership skills
                                        to directly intercede where they are needed most.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Most Guardians have a swagger about them, a cool confidence coupled
                                        with an air of nobility and authority. This poise is often well deserved. Guardians
                                        are capable of surviving and winning battles against overwhelming odds. Their martial
                                        training tends to focus almost exclusively on defense and resilience, leaving a Guardian
                                        as hard i as granite. Hordes of opponents break upon a Guardian like waves upon shoreline
                                        rocks, leaving themselves exhausted and open to devastating counterattacks.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Alone, this combat prowess would be impressive, but a Guardian couples
                                        his abilities with his connection to the Force. This combination makes the Guardian
                                        far more than a mere thug, inspiring compassion and concern for those he protects.
                                        A Guardian’s defensive combat style matches this concern for life. Rather than make
                                        aggressive moves, he gives his opposition every chance to relent and choose a peaceful
                                        resolution. However, if they attack, the Guardian quickly demonstrates why their
                                        choice was the wrong one.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">In many cases, a Guardian becomes established within a particular geographic
                                        region. This might be as large as a group of planets within a sector or as small
                                        as a neighborhood in a large city. A Guardian who focuses on a region in this way
                                        can choose to take stewardship of it. Notably, such stewardship comes out of a sense
                                        of responsibility and duty rather than any actual authority. Guardians seldom assume
                                        political power. Instead, they act in accordance with their internal moral compass,
                                        as guided by the Force, to ensure that everyone under their protection receives the
                                        justice they deserve.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Other Guardians follow the calling of the Force to travel and aid beings
                                        in need wherever they might find them. Many such Guardians wander in a seemingly
                                        aimless fashion, apparently letting random chance direct them where they might need
                                        to go. Almost invariably, their voyages soon lead them to people who desperately
                                        need help.</p>
