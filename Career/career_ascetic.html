                                <p class="card-text">There are many paths that might lead one to the role of Ascetic. Whether
                                        they are particularly sensitive and seek seclusion to contend with some failure that
                                        haunts their steps or wish to contemplate the greater role of the Force in the galaxy
                                        at large, Ascetics are individuals driven to a calmer, more contemplative approach
                                        to their life, their needs, and their place in the galaxy. They do not seek to gather
                                        credits, possessions, or laurels, but rather judge their worth by the depth of their
                                        understanding of and communion with the Force.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">While most Consulars focus on the acquisition of helpful skills and
                                        abilities, Ascetics concentrate on honing their own mind to a razor focus. As a result,
                                        they are likely to have a higher strain threshold than any other Consular specialization,
                                        and they have the versatility to work their way through almost any difficulty. An
                                        Ascetic has spent a considerable time living on the fringes of society, learning
                                        to make do with whatever materials and facilities were on hand, regardless of their
                                        apparent functionality or crude construction. Ascetics may be out of practice in
                                        social interactions and interpersonal communication, but the awareness and resilience
                                        they have gained through their trials, as well as the physical strength their chosen
                                        path has earned them, can be invaluable to a group when more refined, civilized plans
                                        have failed.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">An Ascetic may be found almost anywhere, from the urban wastelands and
                                        undercities of the Core Worlds to the most inhospitable and isolated corners of the
                                        Outer Rim. The distractions and demands of the outside world can jar even the most
                                        focused, powerful minds from the spiritual path. Those who retreat from the noise
                                        and the chaos follow the path of the Ascetic. There are times when even the greatest
                                        must set themselves apart, focusing on the spheres of the spirit and the mind to
                                        the exclusion of all else. By embracing isolation and hardship, many Consulars are
                                        able to realize levels of potential that more mundane training techniques could never
                                        unleash.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Many Ascetics have chosen their lonely path of deprivation and meditation
                                        to plumb the depths of a specific mystery, a troubling event in the balance of the
                                        galaxy, or a great personal failing. The growth made possible through this introspection
                                        and self-denial means that when Ascetics choose to emerge from their self-imposed
                                        exile, they are ideally suited to confront any situation, with the adaptability of
                                        hard-won experience. Often Consulars will surface from such isolation to take up
                                        a particular cause or purpose, driven from quiet contemplation of the galaxy by a
                                        troubling imbalance sensed from the depths of their serenity.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Ascetic can well prove to be one of the most versatile characters
                                        in his group. Between his high strain threshold, demanding physical training, and
                                        versatility bred through voluntary deprivation, an Ascetic can often provide
                                        flexible, insightful leadership to his group. Although perhaps lacking in some
                                        of the more subtle social skills of other Consulars, an Ascetic knows that
                                        meditation on the Force can only take one so far. The knowledge earned through such
                                        rigorous contemplation must eventually be put to use in the galaxy at large,
                                        either through teaching or direct action, to better bring balance to the Force.</p>

                                                in an effort to make amends for their previous failures. This might begin
                                                as a foolish attempt to reconcile themselves with past mistakes, but as the
                                                Force opens itself to them, they begin to walk the unfettered path for its
                                                own sake. The mistakes of the past serve as reminders of the person they
                                                once hoped to becomeâ€”but now the galaxy has moved on, and so too must they.

                                                serve as a smoke screen to galactic citizens. By cutting through the distractions
                                                that cloud the perceptions of those around them, Ascetics allow the truth
                                                to shine through for all to see. To these Consulars, the truth is waiting
                                                to be seen. Revealing it is simply a matter of helping others to see what
                                                is already in front of their eyes.

                                                Ascetics do not search for relics in order to horde it for themselves. Instead,
                                                Ascetics hope to preserve these antiques for future generations, keeping

                                                in a location shrouded in even greater secrecy. To Ascetics, an artifact
                                                that is revealed to a select few and wielded by no one can be preserved until
