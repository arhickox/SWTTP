                                        beyond the Core Worlds, the Fringer is a jack-of-all-trades. He focuses on knowing
                                        how to find what he needs and how to get where he needs to go. He's got the gift
                                        of gab when it's time to talk, and the awareness and reflexes to maneuver away when
                                        it's time to run.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Fringers are skilled navigators, rugged survivalists and many Fringers
                                        are excellent pilots, some rivaling even Smugglers in terms of talent. They are also
                                        highly prized for their ability to navigate ships through the unknown ranges of the
                                        Outer Rim. Fringers can also be tough, wiry, and nimble, surprising any would-be
                                        assailant with their ability to avoid getting hit and avoid getting caught.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">A Player Character Fringer stands a good chance of being either the
                                        primary or secondary pilot for a group; he'll certainly be the likely choice for
                                        handling astrogation duties. He may also be the one the group turns to when it comes
                                        to dealing with employers, or finding a job in the first place. If someone needs
                                        to go into a starport or town to handle business, the Fringer should definitely be
                                        a part of that excursion.</p>

                                                backgrounds, taking what they knew and learned before and adding it to what
                                                they need to know to survive. An academic who finds himself on the Rim may
                                                well take his versatility as a learned man and apply it to his approach to
                                                making his way through life, which is exactly what a Fringer does. A scholastically
                                                minded Fringer may be just the perfect addition to any team trying to make
                                                a living away from the Core.</li>

                                                for the life of a criminal. Inherently opportunistic, Fringers often fail
                                                to see the law as anything but a barrier to whatever goal they have in mind.
                                                Skilled at navigating the edges of society, Fringers actually make excellent
                                                criminal operatives. They tend to know where to go, who to talk to, what's
                                                of value, and how best to get to it. They also tend to be able to fill in
                                                many of the gaps a group may have in their ability pool when planning a caper.</li>

                                                entrepreneurship. Always seeking opportunities, they are often gifted deal-makers
                                                and savvy about who to talk to for whatever they need. A Fringer tends to
                                                be adept at seeing a need; he may not have all the skills or resources to
                                                fulfill that need, but he's sure to know how to go about finding the people
                                                who do. Fringers tend to be "idea people," and if one cannot find a place
                                                in the Core Worlds to make the most of his talents, he'll head out to the
                                                farther worlds where people like him can thrive. Often he'll look for whatever
                                                problem he can find and then go about trying to figure out the best way to

                                                a part of the Empire, they found reason to stop working for such a lucrative
                                                employer and move on to other opportunities. Perhaps one ran afoul of someone
                                                of importance and decided removing himself from the reach of his antagonist
                                                was the right decision. Then again, a Fringer may still be working for the
                                                Empire, out in the far reaches seeking something that will be the key to

                                                flows well into a Fringer lifestyle, where being a jack-ofall- trades is
