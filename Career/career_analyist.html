                                <p class="card-text">The Analyst excels at information processing, leveraging unparalleled
                                        knowledge to gain the edge in any situation. A skilled Analyst can keep a squad appraised
                                        of the situation across the field of battle, or he can find flaws in seemingly invulnerable
                                        defenses. Analysts are more focused on Knowledge skills than most other Diplomats—and
                                        indeed, most other characters in general. As such, Analysts have numerous ways to
                                        turn the information these skills provide directly into opportunities for their teams.
                                        Well-constructed plans that take every factor into account are the Analyst’s forte,
                                        whether they are concocted in combat or in diplomatic encounters.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Knowledge is power, on the battlefield and in negotiations alike. The
                                        Analyst knows this (and a great many other things) better than anyone else. More
                                        importantly, the Analyst knows how to leverage such information to maximum effect,
                                        finding the trends and connections that turn otherwise meaningless facts into crucial
                                        intelligence that might someday decide the outcome of the Galactic Civil War.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">These skills allow Analysts to not only parse and remember vast amounts
                                        of data, but also contextualize it in a way that makes the data useful. The Computers
                                        skill can be particularly valuable, allowing an Analyst to access archives and slice
                                        into communications systems to stay informed. The specialization’s considerable access
                                        to Knowledge skills also allows an Analyst to know a bit about everything.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Some Analysts focus their attention on one specific topic, such as mastering
                                        Rebel Alliance codes tracking data on its units in the field, or monitoring Imperial
                                        activity in specific regions via the HoloNet. Others act as liaisons to political
                                        and military leaders, using their considerable research experience to provide any
                                        information their allies need.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Experienced Analysts are crucial to the diplomatic success of the Rebel
                                        Alliance. Many politicians and leaders look to Analysts for key support, and some
                                        even have a background in such work themselves. Knowing the unique customs of a local
                                        culture can be crucial to the success of a diplomatic mission, so an Analyst must
                                        have access to this information at a moment’s notice. Analysts can be equally important
                                        on the battlefield, identifying troop-movement patterns that betray the foe’s strategy
                                        or providing information about local environmental conditions so the Quartermaster
                                        can properly equip infantry. Wherever they serve, the knowledge and skills of Analysts
                                        save lives as surely as the choices of commanders and the hands of medics.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Analysts work best when they have the opportunity to exhaustively research
                                        a subject before going into the field, but the work of the Rebel Alliance sometimes
                                        requires its representatives to improvise. Therefore, Analysts—especially those attached
                                        to squads with specializations and missions as diverse as most PC groups—must be
                                        prepared to work on the fly. Even without access to data archives or the HoloNet,
                                        a skilled Analyst can effectively observe and break down a situation, identifying
                                        ways the squad can exploit vulnerabilities in enemy strategies and technologies.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">An Analyst benefits from a high Intellect characteristic for making
                                        Computers and Knowledge checks to access and remember information. A high Cunning
                                        also assists Perception checks to spot critical details.</p>

                                                are sometimes researchers. These individuals usually seek to gather as much
                                                data as possible about the group’s situation, so as to arm politicians with

                                                the Rebel Alliance has won many allies by offering a helping hand to the
                                                downtrodden. Analysts let it do so effectively and with respect for local
