                                <p class="card-text">Many Consulars know the universal truth: knowledge is power, and understanding
                                        a situation can give one a decisive advantage. This holds just as true when resolving
                                        disputes or negotiations as it does on the battlefield. A Sage focuses on studying
                                        the world around him, recognizing that information offers tremendous advantages to
                                        himself and his allies. He then uses that power to help change the hearts and minds
                                        of others to achieve his goals.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Sages see knowledge and understanding as the basis for long-term peace
                                        and harmony. It is their belief that hatred often springs from ignorance. When a
                                        sentient comes to appreciate the backgrounds of another being’s beliefs and practices,
                                        it becomes far easier not only accept that being but to feel compassion for him.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Some researchers may become lost in their academic pursuits, obsessing
                                        over dry facts while blind to the plight of the weak and helpless. Not so a Sage,
                                        who maintains connections to those around him via the Living Force. The Force provides
                                        a means of grounding Sages’ studies so that they keep what they learn in perspective,
                                        always mindful of how they can use their knowledge to help others.</p>

                                                thirsty for knowledge, too eager to learn. But for many Sages, years have
                                                now passed, and life has taught them patience. Though they were judged to
                                                be too weak in the Force to become Jedi Padawans, they instead see their
                                                journey in the Force as a long road upon which many hard lessons must be

                                                Knowledge is its own reward, and with it comes understanding. But both are
                                                dangerous during these dark times, and Sages who dig deeply into the secrets
                                                hidden by the Empire often make targets of themselves. As they grow in wisdom,
                                                they are drawn into more danger; to protect themselves, they must become
                                                ever more silent and subtle. Secrets become hoarded treasures and rationed
                                                commodities to be doled out after much deliberation and consideration. Sages
                                                are caught between letting lost knowledge die with them or risking their
                                                lives every time they pass on what they have learned to another.</li>

                                                in the words of elders from the past—but few such mentors remain. Many Sages
                                                instead search for records left behind by lost masters of the Force. But
                                                their truths were hidden (or even destroyed) by the Empire for a reason:
                                                the truth is the most dangerous weapon in the battle against the Empire.
                                                Those who search for it are the most wanted beings in the galaxy, which forces
                                                Sages to conduct their searches with a level of awareness that borders on
                                                paranoia.

                                                to enlighten those caught up in their own struggles so that two factions
                                                might see that they are not so different after all. In the end, all beings
                                                are of the Force, and in that, the Sage hopes to find a universality common
                                                to everyone involved. The wisdom of shared experiences, collective values,
                                                and simple common sense can win the day if only a moment can be taken to
                                                stop and reflect on the situation at hand.
