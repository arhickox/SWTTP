                                <p class="card-text">The Jedi are gone, the vast majority hunted down 
                                        and destroyed by the Emperor and his minions. 
                                        If any survive, they do so in hiding at the farthest 
                                        edges of the galaxy. The Galactic Empire 
                                        regards the ability to use the Force as 
                                        a crime punishable by the harshest 
                                        measures. In a few short decades, 
                                        most of the galaxy has forgotten 
                                        the Jedi, and dismissed the Force as an ancient religion. For many, this is by far 
                                        the safest option.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">However, although the Empire has purged the Jedi, 
                                        not all who use the Force have been hunted down and 
                                        killed. The galaxy is simply too large to track down every 
                                        Force-sensitive being, and the Emperor's infamous Order 66 and the hunts that followed primarily concerned 
                                        themselves with pursuing true Jedi and their descendants and allies. In the hidden corners of the galaxy, 
                                        those who can touch the Force remain hidden, hunted, 
                                        and outcast...but alive.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Although technically someone is Force sensitive 
                                        from birth, it can take a great deal of time for him to 
                                        realize he has this power. For this reason, the Force 
                                        Sensitive Exile specialization can be taken during 
                                        character creation or at any later point, just as any 
                                        other specialization.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Force Sensitive Exile is not just any Force-sensitive being; he is one who survived the purges. 
                                        He may have been a young Padawan or even a 
                                        minor Jedi who managed to flee the Empire and 
                                        hide. He may also have been a child, hidden by 
                                        friends or family. Whatever the case, he's spent the 
                                        last decades in a hostile galaxy. His formal training is likely to be limited or even non-existent, and 
                                        he uses his powers carefully or not at all. Even his 
                                        mastery of the Force is shaped by his experiencesâ€”his powers focus more around concealment 
                                        and control than flashy displays of ability.</p>
