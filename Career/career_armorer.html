                                        logic of Armorers, whose unique combination of aptitudes makes them some of the toughest
                                        characters in the galaxy. Equipped with a knack for mechanics and a preternatural
                                        intuition when it comes to machines, these characters often fight clad in advanced
                                        technology and always use available resources to the utmost. Armorers can go toe-to-toe
                                        with the greatest threats the galaxy can throw at them, confident that their customized
                                        gear and innate resilience will help them shrug off nearly any blow.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Armorers are defined by their ability to survive through a combination
                                        of ingenuity and stubbornness. While Protectors draw directly on the Force to avoid
                                        harm and Soresu Defenders use lightsabers to deflect incoming strikes, Armorers build
                                        a better defense, reinforcing solidly built equipment with the inestimable power
                                        of the Force. Their skills help Armorers in getting the tools they need for the job,
                                        maintaining and using those implements efficiently, and surviving to do it all again.
                                        If this is the character’s starting specialization, he may choose two of these skills
                                        and gain one free rank in each without spending starting experience.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Armorers wield a number of talents that enhance their own armor and
                                        defenses, letting them survive hits that would fell most of their allies. They are
                                        extremely skilled craftspeople, and not only can build and modify their own gear
                                        proficiently, but can also use the Force to bolster their handiwork. With sufficient
                                        training, Armorers can even imbue their armor with the power of the Force, allowing
                                        it to repel blows from lightsabers.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Thanks to their sturdy defenses, Armorers often favor close-quarters
                                        combat, trusting their protection to see them through to melee range. Though lightsabers
                                        are practically legendary in this era of oppression, some Armorers manage to acquire
                                        the kyber crystals necessary to forge these weapons. While Armorers are often practical,
                                        many hold a great reverence for their implements, and this allows them to commune
                                        with a blade in a unique way. The most skilled Armorers can even use their innate
                                        knowledge of the Force to unlock unseen potential in more mundane items, bringing
                                        out qualities that others have overlooked. This mystical ability, combined with an
                                        Armorer’s natural resourcefulness, means that catching an Armorer unarmed and unready
                                        grants only a minimal advantage.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Though they certainly benefit from having a fully stocked machine shop
                                        available, Armorers can also do most of their work on the battlefield, scrounging
                                        and retrofitting the supplies they need. This flexibility can be a substantial advantage,
                                        for the Empire hounds every step that Force users take, and they must be able to
                                        adapt to shifting circumstances and surroundings. If a vessel needs repairing behind
                                        enemy lines or a hull breach must be sealed during a firefight, an Armorer is often
                                        the best sentient being for the job.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Outside of combat, Armorers can be extremely helpful to their allies.
                                        In addition to possessing considerable skill at modifying equipment, they can repair
                                        vehicles and other machines that the group needs kept in working order. While Artisans
                                        have the edge in refined skill with technology and deep research into matters involving
                                        machines, Armorers can get the job done, and do it while under enemy fire.

                                                A character could only have learned such artisan skill from another master
                                                Armorer. An Armorer’s works are all the more practical when tempered with
                                                firsthand training and knowledge. An Armorer might be the foremost user of
                                                the fruits of these labors, or might strive to craft equipment that brings
                                                pride to the tradition. The accumulated experience of generations gives the
                                                PC’s works an almost supernatural quality that can only be attained through
                                                the melding of experience and the calming power of Force techniques.

                                                primarily focus on self-protection rather than making gear for allies. After
                                                all, the Armorer intends to personally take on the deadliest foes, suffering
                                                any blow to keep allies safe. Such a philosophy of making oneself as indestructible
                                                as possible for the sake of others has merit on the battlefield, but it can
                                                also lead to a disregard for personal safety. Even clad in the perfect protections,
                                                an Armorer who always insists on being the one to take the heavy hits might
                                                need to address the roots of these self-sacrificing tendencies to find inner

                                                find an Armorer’s skills to be extremely useful, especially when dealing
                                                with the sort of esoteric, illegal equipment that does not come with a warranty.
                                                There is good money to be made selling weapons and armor to crime syndicates,
                                                pirates, and other outlaws. Some Armorers have strict scruples about who

                                                before handing over their wares. Of course, an Armorer in the underworld
                                                also has to be capable of watching out for number one, and so the character
