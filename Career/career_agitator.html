                                <p class="card-text">The Empire's main weapon, more effective than all of the incredible
                                        firepower at its disposal, is fear. Fear lets it maintain order and authority over
                                        the countless beings in its thrall. The Agitator's primary goal is to remove that
                                        fear and replace it with anger, or courage, or a sense of righteousness—whatever
                                        it takes to get the people to rise up, take up arms, reject Palpatine's tyranny,
                                        and restore freedom and justice to the galaxy.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Agitators often bully the bullies to move them out of the way, and when
                                        they are able to get the people to follow them, they know how to lead. Understanding
                                        the ways of the streets is also vital to survival and success.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Most Agitators come by the calling through hardship and suffering. Their
                                        own personal tragedies at the hands of their oppressors drive them to call upon others
                                        to resist injustice and authoritarianism. Some are more altruistic in nature, sufficiently
                                        moved by the suffering of others to take action and rouse the people to a cause in
                                        which they can believe. Only those with charisma and will in sufficient quantities
                                        can truly succeed in this dangerous and demanding course.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Many in the Alliance's upper levels consider Agitators a necessary evil;
                                        they are not keen to move populations of untrained civilians to go to war against
                                        the Empire's stormtroopers and other resources, yet they accept that, ultimately,
                                        it will take the entire galaxy doing just that if victory is to be achieved. When
                                        possible, Agitators are supported by other Alliance operatives, and a plan to arm
                                        and support the populace is usually in place before the Agitator goes to work.</p>

                                                Agitators who champion small groups are often adept at stirring the emotions
                                                of outsiders through demonstrations and fiery rhetoric. These rabble-rousers
                                                are often uncompromising in their search for justice, but such zeal is an

                                                unions amid their fellow laborers to rise to heights of power. Agitators

                                                protest are utterly inseparable. Rousing a crowd with song or using graffiti
                                                to protest a cruel regime is simply natural to them. Thus, these individuals
