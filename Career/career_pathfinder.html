                                <p class="card-text">Few are as capable of exploring a planet and discovering its secrets
                                        as a Pathfinder. The combination of Pathfinders’ Force talents and their training
                                        enables them to quickly and precisely complete a search, even under the most adverse
                                        conditions. A Pathfinder can survive in a hostile wilderness for weeks or months,
                                        living off the land with minimal supplies and possibly a faithful companion animal.
                                        In fact, some Pathfinders are said to be able to bond with their companions through
                                        the Force, communicating with them mentally, seeing through their senses, and even
                                        directing their actions.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Pathfinder's skills are focused on complementing the Seeker’s career
                                        skills, so that the character becomes even more capable of operating independently.
                                        The addition of Medicine is primarily for personal benefit but can also be useful
                                        in aiding the character’s companions.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Some Pathfinders follow this career because they discover they have
                                        a knack for independent survival. This is most commonly true for Force-sensitive
                                        individuals who matured on primitive and uncivilized planets.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">If his small community was surrounded by hostile wilderness, a character
                                        is certain to have spent his youth exploring that environment—likely making friends
                                        with many of the wild animals present there. Pathfinders’ natural abilities likely
                                        led them to a position of some responsibility within their tribe. Their roles might
                                        have included securing the safety of the surrounding wilderness and maintaining any
                                        trails leading to agricultural resources or other necessities needed by the community’s
                                        residents.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Others who follow the Pathfinder career do so out of a preference for
                                        the company of animals over that of sentient beings. Through their Force abilities,
                                        some learn to establish effective communications with the relatively primitive minds.
                                        In these interactions, they find that they enjoy the sincerity and straightforward
                                        nature of wild creatures.</p>
