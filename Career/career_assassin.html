                                <p class="card-text">Whereas most Bounty Hunters focus primarily on the capture of quarry,
                                        those who specialize as Assassins are generally tasked with the straightforward proposition
                                        of terminating their targets. Assassins tend to prefer getting in quietly, taking
                                        out targets (either up close or sniping from afar), and leaving just as silently
                                        as they entered. Their talents are very appropriate for this kind of work.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Despite their different methods, Assassins still adhere to many of the
                                        same ethics and practices of other Bounty Hunters. They take their work very seriously,
                                        avoid all needless bloodshed, and honor their contracts to the letter. Some treat
                                        their methods with reverence, even assigning a certain mystique to it. Others simply
                                        see themselves as cold killers, and are just fine with it.</p>

                                                beyond what it takes to maintain their equipment. A
                                                good blade or rifle, a suit of black clothing, and a tendency toward skulking and hiding in shadows looks, at
                                                first glance, to be an achievable goal for anyone with
                                                moderate resources. While this is true, a number of
                                                assassins are very concerned with money. Some do not
                                                chase it to keep themselves in fast ships and high-tech
                                                gear, however: they chase the status that comes along
                                                with it. The best assassins are the most expensive, and
                                                there are individuals whose fees are in the hundreds of
                                                thousands or even millions of credits for a single job.
                                                While this money does buy them a high standard of
                                                living, it also ensures that only the wealthiest, most
                                                discerning clients can afford their services—and the
                                                higher-class the customer, the more prestigious the job.

                                                of Assassins as motivated by something as high-minded as a dedication to law and order. There are
                                                those, however, for whom dispensing justice is paramount. These hunters

                                                who go about collecting their bounties with a minimum of fuss.
                                                 Whether with a blaster rifle from a kilometer away or the deft use of a blade or garrote, the
                                                majority of Assassins wish only to kill their target and
                                                collect their money. Further, most Assassins view
                                                anyone who kills for any reason other than financial
                                                gain as deranged; they are professionals, after all, not
                                                mere murderers. Some Assassins, however, are not so
                                                discerning—killing is something they enjoy, and they
                                                would do it even if they weren’t being paid. These
                                                hunters quietly stalk their targets, following them
                                                constantly and often approaching close enough to
                                                touch them before fading back into the crowd. They leave little hints to their presence and purpose where
                                                their targets can find them, and ratchet up the pressure and paranoia before delivering the killing blow.
                                                For them, a clean, fast kill, while efficient and professional, is hardly worthwhile at all.
