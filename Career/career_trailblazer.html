                                <p class="card-text">When facing a numerically superior enemy with access to better weapons,
                                        armor, and supplies, an army must leverage absolutely every advantage possible. The
                                        Soldiers of the Alliance to Restore the Republic have grown accustomed to fighting
                                        while outnumbered and outgunned, and have honed their wits to compensate and regain
                                        the advantage against the Empire. One area in which rebel Soldiers frequently have
                                        the edge is in knowledge of the terrain and how to use it. Even stormtroopers, the
                                        supposed elite of the Empire, frequently fall prey to its rigid modes of thinking,
                                        and Trailblazers can use their superior knowledge of the terrain and unorthodox tactics
                                        to surprise and overwhelm their foes.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Catching the enemy off-guard is one of the oldest and most diverse tactics
                                        in the galaxy, and Trailblazers seek to turn it to their advantage at every turn.
                                        Survival makes the Trailblazer better at tracking foes and setting clever traps,
                                        while Stealth helps in avoiding enemies who might uncover the Trailblazer’s presence.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Trailblazers tend to favor patience and indirrect solutions, pitting
                                        the foe against the wilderness or using the features of the terrain to eliminate
                                        enemy advantages. Heavy walkers cannot function in the confines of a forest, for
                                        instance, nor can massive infantry surges push through urban environments without
                                        exposing themselves to risk. Trailblazers work to make the best of cover and prefer
                                        to fight on their own turf, where they can turn every piece of their knowledge to
                                        their advantage. The Cunning Snare talent, in particular, shines here, giving the
                                        Trailblazer the ability to set up a devastating trap for unsuspecting foes. While
                                        this talent takes some setup to use, the payout can be considerable, levelling a
                                        fight with a numerically superior or better-equipped foe. The Trailblazer can even
                                        use this talent without advanced supplies, using cleverness and wood- craft to overcome
                                        dire situations if the PCs are ever stranded without access to optimal gear— and
                                        on the shifting battlefields of the Galactic Civil War, Soldiers of the Rebellion
                                        can find themselves cut off and without support in an instant.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Trailblazers often act as guides to other members of their squads, helping
                                        them to avoid the dangers of the wild and the battlefield alike as the group moves
                                        to the most advantageous position possible. A skilled Trailblazer can not only allow
                                        a group of PCs to win difficult battles through subterfuge and trickery, but also
                                        to avoid unnecessary battles entirely. The Rebel Alliance frequently needs to achieve
                                        objectives without the Empire noticing, and so the best battle is often the one that
                                        was never fought. A Trailblazer can be a substantial boon to any group in other contexts,
                                        too, whether the PCs are moving through the wilds or the streets of a city.</p>

                                                environmental advantages to fight the Empire on the windswept snowdrifts
                                                of Orto Plutonia. The Dressellians are perhaps the most famous wilderness
                                                fighters standing against Imperial occupation of their homeworld, but any
                                                untamed planet under Imperial control probably has a local resistance largely

                                                underdeveloped worlds of vast wilderness. Their familiarity with their home
                                                terrain makes them quick students of guerrilla warfare, and with a little
                                                training, they become a serious threat to local Imperial operations. The
                                                bulk of rebel recruits receive training in this sort of asymmetrical warfare
