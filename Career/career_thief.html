                        <div class="card-body">
                                <p class="card-text">Where the Scoundrel is a bit flashier, and the Pilot focuses on mastering
                                        his ship, the Thief really is a covert operative. His ideal circumstance is to get
                                        into places blocked to others, grab things he's not supposed to have, and get out
                                        without anyone ever knowing he was there. If he can sell what he grabbed for a tidy
                                        sum, that makes for a perfect day.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Combined with his talents, a Thief is particularly adept at hiding,
                                        spotting the hidden, getting past locks and security, and getting the jump on opponents
                                        in combat. He also knows his way around the underworld and where to get what's needed.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Generally, Thieves tend to either operate with a group that shares in
                                        their larcenous goals, or they work alone. The galaxy is full of treasures, many
                                        of which are guarded by locks and goons. A Thief will gladly handle the locks, though
                                        he'll probably appreciate having some back-up to handle the goons if things go badly.
                                        Then again, if he's truly good at what he does, that shouldn't happen. Some Thieves
                                        gain a strong enough reputation that they are offered contract opportunities by powerful
                                        people or groups, seeking to accomplish something against an opponent that is far
                                        beyond the realms of legal action. Of course, Thieves must always be on the lookout
                                        for a double-cross.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">As a part of a Player Character team, a Thief may not even identify
                                        himself by his specialization, preferring to display skills and abilities that are
                                        more generically appropriate to his career as a Smuggler. Frankly, most Smugglers
                                        have at least some skill in the areas that he is masterful with, so he might never
                                        have to reveal much more than that. Still, having a master Thief on a team may mean
                                        getting into—and out of—some seriously difficult places in the future.</p>

                                                unfairly accused of stealing. Once a Thief crosses the line, he may as well
                                                embrace the life and became a professional. A respectable Thief might steal

                                                smuggling second nature. It may be an effort for such a Thief to resist stealing
