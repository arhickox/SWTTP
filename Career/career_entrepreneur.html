                                <p class="card-text">Entrepreneurs know that there is only one thing worth investing in—the
                                        future. Entrepreneurs are not unlike explorers in the world of business; they want
                                        to be the first to open up new markets, to revolutionize industrial practices, or
                                        to create new service industries people hadn't realized they needed, but once sampled,
                                        cannot live without.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">While the Entrepreneur is willing to bully, charm, or mislead others
                                        to achieve his ends, he prefers to rely on negotiations, bringing to bear facts,
                                        graphs, and projections for the future. In this way the Entrepreneur is similar to
                                        the Scholar. However, unlike Scholars, the Entrepreneur operates under the assumption
                                        that every problem can be overcome with a big enough credit stick.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Entrepreneurs may be free with their money, but they are never wasteful,
                                        and they are always looking for ways to cut costs, even if it skirts regulations.
                                        Most savvy businesspeople know that if one only plays by the rules, then one can
                                        only ever be as successful as the rules allow. Since the rules are usually written
                                        by the established corporations the Entrepreneur competes against, he believes the
                                        rules exist solely as a means to restrict progress, stifle innovation, and suppress
                                        competition. In short, rules were made to be broken. Even the most upstanding businessperson
                                        occasionally contracts operatives for industrial espionage or corporate intelligence
                                        gathering, and even if he morally objects to that behavior, he needs to know how
                                        to defend against it.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">It is said that a sucker is born every second, and the Entrepreneur
                                        takes great pains to make certain he is never one of them. In all of his dealings,
                                        the Entrepreneur must remain vigilant against conversational traps laid by opponents
                                        during delicate negotiations. Preparedness is always a part of the plan, so that
                                        risk is mitigated and no circumstances result in absolute failure.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Every group can benefit from counting an Entrepreneur among its number.
                                        Their ability to negotiate a favorable deal in any number of circumstances, and the
                                        resources at their disposal, make Entrepreneurs invaluable members of the team. They
                                        make excellent leaders, and any party who allows an Entrepreneur to negotiate on
                                        its behalf will be pleased with the results. The Entrepreneur can also act as team
                                        quartermaster, outfitting the group with specialized, hard-to-find equipment with
                                        little notice, and both his pool of contacts and credit pouch are deep enough to
                                        keep the party informed on almost any subject.</p>

                                                mine, a good location for trade, or a local product that could generate off-world

                                                helping people and making money can go hand in hand, provided one keeps an
                                                open mind. An idealist Entrepreneur might see an economically depressed settlement
                                                not as an unfortunate inevitability, but rather as an opportunity for investment
                                                nobody else has identified yet. For instance, while taking a stake in a failing
