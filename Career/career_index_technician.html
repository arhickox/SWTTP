                <h1>Technician Specializations</h1>

                <div class="card career-text-card">
                        <div class="card-body">
                                <p class="card-text">Pretty much anything to do with technology or mechanical devices lies
                                        within the Technician's purview. He knows how to operate, maintain, repair, and upgrade
                                        just about anything with power or gears. Most Technicians would rather deal with
                                        machines and droids than people; the latter are just too unpredictable.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Technicians can be found almost anywhere, at any tier of society or
                                        in any location where there's even a few machines. Formality—even cleanliness—tends
                                        to fall far outside their daily concerns. They usually smell of some kind of grease,
                                        solvent, or other substance that's used on machines, and even their cleanest clothes
                                        are seldom free from stains. Even those Technicians that move among the higher echelons
                                        come off as rumpled and slouching; it's just not in their nature to put on a professional
                                        front. They let their work speak for itself.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Note that Technicians do have a sense of pride, and it resides in the
                                        work they perform. If a Technician brings someone a piece of tech that he's not only
                                        repaired but upgraded with some very useful modifications, the reaction of the recipient
                                        can make or break his entire day.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">This is why Technicians tend to gravitate to one another socially, or
                                        bond with someone who has an appreciation for machinery. Cadgeteeroriented Bounty
                                        Hunters and Smugglers are most likely to befriend a Technician in a group. This can
                                        be a mutually beneficial relationship, considering all of the wonderful things a
                                        technically proficient individual can do for someone's gear.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Like Pilots and Doctors, Technicians of almost any specialization will
                                        have a relatively easy time finding work in the Outer Rim. Every operation, from
                                        small farmsteads to large space stations, has need of those who can keep the tech
                                        running. Criminal overlords particularly enjoy having a Technician on their payroll,
                                        not only to take care of their many assets, but also to craft the occasional "toy"
                                        for them with which to surprise their enemies.</p>
