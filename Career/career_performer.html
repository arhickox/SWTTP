                                <p class="card-text">The Performer must always be the center of attention, and if all eyes
                                        aren't on the Performer, he has ways to make them shift their focus. For them, all
                                        the world is a stage, and the Performer is always putting on a show. They can lie
                                        with more sincerity than even the Politico, and do so as easily as if they were running
                                        lines for a one-man showing of the Kallea Cycle. They can be as charming as a diplomat,
                                        and leave their targets enchanted and completely manipulatable. And far too many
                                        people underestimate the strength many Performers must possess for acrobatics, athletics,
                                        and even live theater.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Performer often leans on pouts, winks, warm smiles, and well timed
                                        physical contact mixed with out-right lies to get whatever he wants from whomever
                                        he wants. He draws on the best lines from the greatest works of literature, theater,
                                        and holo from millennia past, and always has a unique, flattering compliment for
                                        any being from whom he might want something.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Other Performers may rely on different tactics in their interactions.
                                        A cutting comedian or brilliant actor can hurl a litany of insults that cut to the
                                        core of most beings, making them question their worth and their right to deny the
                                        Performer what he wants. Unfortunately, these almost psychotic breaks are just as
                                        likely to be directed against their closest allies and assistants as enemies. The
                                        Performer knows how to use this to his advantage, though, and can create a scene
                                        to distract a bouncer while his friends sneak into a club that would otherwise never
                                        have granted them access.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">However, there is often more to a Performer than just words. Performers
                                        may include dancers, acrobats, jugglers, and other individuals who must possess impressive
                                        coordination and be at peak physical condition. Their acrobatic abilities can give
                                        some Performers an unexpected edge in a fight. In addition, many have been trained
                                        in martial arts and the use of stage weaponry for roles in theater or holovids. The
                                        agility and overall fitness required to perform on stage means they are often in
                                        great shape, and as such, it is not uncommon for the Performer to be the last one
                                        standing when the dust settles.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Whether the character is a galaxy-famous magician or merely the member
                                        of a traveling troupe of acrobats, the players can build their entire party around
                                        a Performer. Performers need an agent, bodyguards, assistants, technicians for their
                                        performance, a pilot, perhaps a personal physician, and certain friends or family
                                        for their entourage. Performers are able to take the lead in social situations and
                                        provide support during combat, but can also take a back seat to a diplomatic leader
                                        able to wrangle him. The konly downside to including a Performer in the party is
                                        that whatever his specialty, he makes his living through some sort of acting. Once
                                        can never be sure what a Performer thinks about everyone else.</p>

                                                evening to brighten their drab lives. However, a Performer can easily outstay

                                                could have ended up an unwilling colonist as he traveled from one poorly
                                                paying gig to another. Finally he settled down as the permanent entertainment
                                                of a local cantina. Now he spends his nights performing for the same, unappreciative
                                                crowd while knowing in his heart that he could have been a star given half

                                                they stood up for what they believed in, and that put them in opposition
                                                to the Empire. They may have used their status as a known public persona
                                                to spread a message of defiance. Now they're on the run, marked for arrest
                                                (or even execution) by the Imperial authorities. Since they may have been
                                                a prominent figure in their previous life, their defiance is even more galling

                                                theater as legal precedent, and for those reasons, a Performer might have
                                                served as the town's barrister or advocate. Where modem investigative techniques

                                                a client often relies on the advocate's ability to sway the crowd to his

                                                the intrinsic worth of their craft—after all, if they did not believe that
                                                their art served some purpose in society, even if that purpose was merely
                                                to lighten the cares of others, they would not pursue mastery so fervently.
                                                Further, many are not just entertainers, but keepers of cultural history
                                                in the form of dance, song, or story. These Performers often travel the Outer

                                                the last protectors of precious ideas and art that the Empire would see erased
