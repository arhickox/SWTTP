                                <p class="card-text">Where the Ace Pilot uses hard-won skill, technique, and by-the-book
                                        tactics, the Hotshot is naturally gifted, overly aggressive, and makes the rest up
                                        as he speeds along. For the Hotshot, risk-taking isn't just a style of flying, it's
                                        a way of life. You can always depend on a Hotshot to go for it when he sees an opportunity
                                        to achieve a goal. There are few things in the galaxy more impressive than watching
                                        a Hotshot when everything is going his way. though it's best to switch channels on
                                        the comms, because the only thing a Hotshot likes more than his own flying is bragging
                                        about it afterward.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Rebellion has a nearly endless supply of new Hotshot bush pilots
                                        accustomed to racing T-16s on their backwater homeworlds, but very few Hotshot veterans.
                                        These courageous freedom fighters prefer improvisation to careful planning, much
                                        to their commanders' chagrin. Those Hotshots whose luck never seems to run out quickly
                                        become heroes and legends to the rank and file of the Rebel Alliance.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Hotshot keeps his head in the face of overwhelming odds, and has
                                        a great degree of control over his chosen vehicle. Finesse and precision flying,
                                        combined with the Hotshot's unrestrained bravery, mean that Hotshots prefer to go
                                        after the toughest or biggest groups of enemies first, diving headlong into the thickest
                                        part of the battle.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Hotshot is all about taking the big risks, both in combat and in
                                        life. He rarely considers the consequences or the alternatives. When he sees a chance,
                                        he takes it without blinking. This unpredictable and often irrational behavior, combined
                                        with the raw talent and control a Hotshot has in the cockpit, makes him a lethal
                                        adversary. Of course, there is no reward without risk, and sometimes the Hotshot
                                        risks too much. If not for the support of their allies, most Hotshots would probably
                                        have died a dozen times over.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Rebellion usually puts Hotshots through their paces in simulators
                                        before letting them get into a real fight. However, the Rebels can't afford to keep
                                        their best combat Aces sidelined for long. Command usually assigns Hotshots to X-wing
                                        or A-wing squadrons, or to other light, maneuverable vehicles that take full advantage
                                        of a Hotshot's preternatural skill. Veteran Hotshots are usually retired once their
                                        value as a symbol eclipses whatever good they might do on the battlefield. High Command
                                        often parades them around on low-risk, high-visibility missions, or transfers them
                                        to training commands.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Any group can benefit from the honed dogfighting skills of a Hotshot.
                                        However, despite the Hotshot's predilection for flying into combat ahead of his squadron,
                                        he works best when he has a team not far behind, cleaning up whatever enemies the
                                        Hotshot misses. A vehicle formation with a Hotshot in the lead usually results in
                                        a costly engagement for the enemy, as long as the Hotshot's luck holds out.</p>

                                                The Rebel Alliance often asks Hotshots with this sort of experience to perform

                                                often bite off more than they can chew, but their pride compels them to follow

                                                during the Clone Wars, but those who did became legends with reputations
                                                of heroism and bravery in the face of overwhelming odds. The more famous

                                                when they get in the way of their egos. A Hotshot's complete disregard for
