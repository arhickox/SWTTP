                                <p class="card-text">Criminals might run and criminals might hide, but the Marshal won't
                                        rest until he drags them back to town in binders. The presence of a strong Marshal
                                        is often the only thing keeping a colony from plunging into chaos. The Marshal has
                                        a gift for extracting information from witnesses and confessions from criminals,
                                        and separating lies and irrelevant information from the truth. Should suspects turn
                                        violent, the Marshal is equally adept at talking criminals into a pair of binders
                                        or blasting them into oblivion.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Where most Colonists are forced to rely on talking their way out of
                                        trouble, the Marshal finds that his blaster speaks almost as well as he does. Most
                                        law officers know that holding the weight of the law over a potential witness is
                                        the quickest way ) modify his attitude. Marshals can throw the veight of their authority
                                        around to get answers. There is little government oversight on the fringe, and often
                                        a Marshal's word is the law.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Equally as important is the Marshal's knowledge of crime and criminal
                                        elements, especially those operating within his jurisdiction. A Marshal who doesn't
                                        take the time to familiarize himself with the local malcontents isn't going to be
                                        very good at his job. And when it comes time to go toe to toe with those criminals,
                                        the Marshal is ready. Most Marshals know how to use the blasters at their hips.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Marshal makes for a great leader in combat-oriented groups, or can
                                        provide some muscle to non-combat groups while still participating in social and
                                        investigative encounters. Marshals strike a great balance between social skills and
                                        combat, allowing them to speak on behalf of combat-oriented parties without being
                                        a liability when blaster bolts start flying. Their ability to sort fact from fiction
                                        makes them difficult to manipulate, and their gritty determination can carry an entire
                                        group that would have otherwise given up hope of success.</p>

                                                may be in a similar position to that of the Politico. A Marshal who arrives
                                                in a colony may be sent by a larger law enforcement agency to bring law and
                                                order to a wild frontier. In that case, the locals are likely to respond
                                                with mistrust and resentment. However, sometimes a Marshal is brought in
                                                by some local community members who want to hire a professional to keep the
                                                peace in their settlement. In this case, the Marshal can at least count on
                                                the backing of some prominent individuals, but may also feel beholden to
                                                them.

                                                career fight ing against lawlessness and banditry, only to eventually realize
                                                that his fellow citizens didn't appreciate his efforts. Perhaps he watched
                                                his town descend into violence over some sort of feud, or the colony lynched
                                                one of his prisoners before the prisoner could be put on trial. In any case,
                                                this left the Marshal with a pessimistic view of his fellows, and the depressing
                                                realization that his life's work may have been in vain.</li>

                                                been a crooked cop in his prior life. Accepting bribes, demanding "protection"
                                                money, or using his position to eliminate anyone in his way could have led
                                                a lawman down a dark road. Forced to flee or face justice for his actions,
                                                he now finds himself with a new start, and a stark choice. Does he resume
                                                his old habits, or attempt to rise above them?</li>

                                                start as the foreperson of a mine or ranch. In this position, he would have
                                                to direct and lead his employees, investigate problems amongst the workforce,
                                                and even keep the mine or ranch safe from bandits or marauding wildlife.
                                                In this case, the character would have to be tough, resourceful, and able
                                                to command fear and respect.</li>

                                                motives, and while some try to uphold the law at all costs, others are more
                                                concerned with the pursuit of justice, for which laws can be both an instrument
                                                and an impediment. A Marshal might well venture into the Outer Rim in the
                                                hopes of protecting the weak and punishing the guilty without the constraining
                                                laws and regulations that might bind the actions of an individual in the
                                                Core Worlds. The Empire's rule often puts the law and justice at odds with
                                                one another, and when faced with the choice between the two, many people
                                                choose to reject an unjust society and find their own path. Few inhabitants
                                                of the Outer Rim are likely to care much about whether a helpful stranger
                                                had to break a few rules written by corrupt bureaucrats on a far-away world
                                                to bring justice to the wicked.</li>
