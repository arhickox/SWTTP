                                <p class="card-text">Due to Age of Rebellion's focus on the Galactic Civil 
                                        War, most groups of PCs find themselves embroiled 
                                        in conflict very quickly. Against a force like the Empire, 
                                        any form of military training can mean the difference 
                                        between life and death. While the Alliance isn't as organized or regimented as the Empire, they do try to give 
                                        a decent number of their members some form of combat training. This training helps to enhance the Rebels' 
                                        chance not only to survive in combat but to fight effectively to achieve their goals.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Recruit specialization is a universal specialization, and the experience cost to take it is ten times 
                                        the total number of specializations that the character would have after adding the new specialization. 
                                        While this means that the specialization costs the 
                                        same as a career specialization, note that universal specializations are not career specializations.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Alliance operatives 
                                        who go through this training enhance their physical fitness, awareness, and general competency at 
                                        a wide variety of skills. Those who commit extra 
                                        time and effort can also enhance their abilities with 
                                        weapons and ground vehicles, as well as their general knowledge of the many worlds to which they 
                                        may end up traveling.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Characters from almost any career can benefit from 
                                        becoming a Recruit and gaining some basic military 
                                        training. Small teams of specialists going up against 
                                        the Empire's best will likely need to call upon every 
                                        scrap of combat ability they collectively possess to 
                                        survive dramatic fights for their very lives.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Alliance strongly recommends such training 
                                        for any Rebels who are actively going into the field, 
                                        regardless of their career, goals, or role in a team. Even 
                                        Diplomats are actively encouraged to undergo military 
                                        training; they do no good to anyone if they cannot 
                                        come back alive from their latest efforts to negotiate 
                                        a treaty or acquire supplies. Becoming a Recruit might 
                                        not make a character a full-fledged special forces hero, 
                                        but it certainly doesn't hurt.</p>
