                                <p class="card-text">While most Seekers are often solitary and self-reliant by nature, some
                                        go beyond this simple tendency toward reclusion and desire to operate independently.
                                        A life isolated from the impositions and irritations of outsiders is instead the
                                        goal for them, so that they can develop their abilities and connections to the Force
                                        in relative calm. Free from outside distractions, these Hermits can further themselves
                                        in ways previously unimaginable to them. Those who can be convinced to rejoin society
                                        can be of great value, not only in their use of the Force but also in dealing with
                                        wilderness survival and deadly creatures.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">For Hermits, solitude is not necessarily a result of abhorring social
                                        interactions or lacking any skills with them. Some Hermits might have even sought
                                        remote life to escape from outside entanglements. They may have had crushing debts,
                                        had bounties placed on their heads, or even deserted from the Imperial military.
                                        Hermits who desire seclusion after discovering their nascent Force abilities may
                                        use their isolation to more fully concentrate on uncovering the secrets of their
                                        mysterious new powers. Meditation can not only help them become more in tune with
                                        the Force, but also strengthen their connection with nature and the surrounding wildlife.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Hermits are not only solitary and self-reliant, but also seek to maintain
                                        their isolation against intruders and others who would disturb their reclusive existence.
                                        Some even hone their ability to avoid others to great extent, the better to escape
                                        unwanted attention.To represent this, Hermit's skills allow them to better develop
                                        their connections not only with the Force, but also local with flora and fauna.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Despite their previously isolated ways of life, though, Hermits are
                                        powerful additions to groups. When parties are stranded in harsh environments, whether
                                        sweltering jungles or barren ice wastelands, Hermits likely feel they are returning
                                        to their homes. Many find such locations more relaxing than the intense industry
                                        and frantic pace of typical cities, especially in Core systems. Their skills in dealing
                                        with these wilderness regions makes them invaluable for ensuring the party’s survival
                                        when the characters venture into the wilds.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Hermits’ skills in uncivilized areas also comes into play when facing
                                        dangerous animals or untamed creatures the group desires to use as steeds. Living
                                        in the wild, Hermits often develop close bonds with their fellow creatures and can
                                        form companionships that might last lifetimes. Many of these Seekers use their Force
                                        abilities, possibly unconsciously, to strengthen established connections with animals
                                        as well as to form new ones.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Despite having lived in isolation for long periods, Hermits are not
                                        unprepared for conflict. Most have maintained themselves well, simply in order to
                                        survive in an unforgiving wilderness where weather and even local plant life can
                                        be as hostile as any sentient enemy. Dealing with dangerous creatures and honing
                                        themselves to avoid such attacks can turn Hermits into equally dangerous combatants.
                                        Overall, this solitude can build powerful individuals, able not only to thrive in
                                        the harshest of environments but also to aid others unprepared for life outside advanced
                                        urban settings.</p>

                                                behind so much as traded them out for new ones. Their past circumstances
                                                still shape their future, but new refuges offer them a sanctuary most other
                                                exiles lack. Nevertheless, they may still need to maintain a low profile
                                                or to avoid notice from those they once knew. The need to lie low might have
                                                even led to the initial foray into the wilderness that made them who they

                                                travel. Hermits in search of wisdom might have dozens of questions on their
                                                minds at any moment, but they can usually find answers or flashes of inspiration
                                                from within, through the Force, or in their immediate surroundings. Even
                                                when they are called beyond their usual environment, Hermits never travel
                                                as far on a starship as they might while journeying through their own meditating
                                                mind.</li>

                                                reaches of the wilderness, some take it further than others. For those who
                                                dwell in the most secluded regions, the distant wilds are their true home,
                                                and the busy hubbub of galactic civilization is the true mystery. It is perhaps
                                                for this reason that such Hermits might eventually leave their solitude and
                                                join society at last. They might seek to solve the mystery of the unfamiliar
                                                and trade their knowledge for other secrets, much as Seekers from more populated
                                                worlds might travel beyond their homes in their own quests for understanding.</li>

                                        <li><b class="bold-gold">Survivor: </b>For as long as there has been civilization,
                                                there have been those who have scorned it as decadent and soft. The wild
                                                places of harsh planets can make those who survive them strong, even as they
                                                winnow out those too weak or fearful to remain. Many Hermits live by some
                                                variation on this philosophy, whether one as ruthless as the environments
                                                they seek to master, or a more noble ascetic discipline that seeks to build
                                                true inner strength.</li>

                                        <li><b class="bold-gold">Wanderer: </b>The lives of Hermits are typically thought
                                                of as being sedentary, but that isn’t necessarily the case. While many Hermits
                                                make a residence out in the wilderness, others abandon the notion of a singular
                                                home altogether. Some such individuals take this extra step to further toughen
                                                themselves, seeing even a crude hut or cave as enough shelter to be a sign
                                                of weakness or excess. Others view their attitude as a step toward enlightenment,
                                                regarding the whole of the galaxy as their home instead of limiting themselves
                                                to a single system, world, nation, or settlement. Some Hermits might not
                                                even consider the issue, being too preoccupied with the mysteries of the
                                                Force and philosophical quandaries to spend time worrying about such mundane
                                                matters.</li>
