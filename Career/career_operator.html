                                <p class="card-text">To catch a target, a Bounty Hunter must be fast,
                                        and even the swiftest sentient being cannot hope
                                        to outrace a speeder or starship on foot. An Operator
                                        prefers to undertake all pursuits from within a vehicle or spacecraft, keeping
                                        the target in sight
                                        with deft maneuvering and on the
                                        run with withering firepower. In
                                        a high-speed chase, few characters can match an Operator’s expertise, and fewer
                                        still
                                        are prepared for the arsenal
                                        of daring moves and dirty
                                        tricks she can unleash.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">A high Agility rating always benefits an Operator,
                                        especially when paired with a solid investment in
                                        Gunnery and Piloting (Planetary) or Piloting (Space),
                                        depending on the Operator’s preferred vehicle. An
                                        Operator also benefits from an investment in Intellect, as this characteristic
                                        is used for both the Astrogation skill—critical in tracking quarry across the
                                        galaxy—and for the Mechanics skill.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Even if the Operator is not the group’s main technical expert,
                                        having a strong Intellect and a rank
                                        or two of Mechanics means that the Operator
                                        can make repairs on the fly. After all, most
                                        Operators put their craft through its paces
                                        (and even push beyond its limits from time
                                        to time). Knowing how to fix an overtaxed
                                        engine can be the difference between staying on the trail and drifting for
                                        weeks, waiting for
                                        a repair team to arrive. Any Bounty Hunter who has
                                        spent time adrift in space knows full well the value of
                                        being able to perform one’s own repairs.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Operators are sometimes lone wolves, chasing
                                        their targets across the gulfs between the stars
                                        with no company but a trusty ship. However, many Operators are part of teams of
                                        bounty hunters, conveying their comrades
                                        on to the location of their foes and running starship interference while they
                                        capture targets on the ground. Some such
                                        Operators are loathe to leave their ships
                                        entirely, though disembarking from time
                                        to time is usually unavoidable on the hunt.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Unlike many other specializations focused on piloting, Operators
                                        need to disable enemy ships rather
                                        than just destroy them. The Operator specialization gives a character access to
                                        numerous talents that help bring targets to a halt, including Debilitating
                                        Shot, Hindering Shot, Overwhelm Defenses, and
                                        Offensive Driving. All of these abilities are useful for taking down fleeing
                                        starships—or, in a
                                        pinch, disabling the vessels of rival bounty
                                        hunters pursuing the same quarry.</p>

                                                spacers that a starship
                                                is just a hole in space to throw credits into. While all
                                                spacers have some idea that owning a ship is a pricey
                                                proposition, Operators know all too well the numerous hidden costs of
                                                keeping a galaxy-hopping craft
                                                functional for any length of time. First there is the
                                                initial purchase price, registration with various official
                                                agencies, the fitting out, and, of course, expensive
                                                insurance. Then come the thousands of fees hidden to
                                                all but those who travel for a living: customs, docking
                                                and berthing, fueling and arming, repairs and maintenance, and for
                                                some, constant and costly modifications. For many Operators, it seems
                                                sometimes they
                                                are working for their ship more than for themselves,
                                                and it shows in their receipts.
