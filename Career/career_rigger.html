                                <p class="card-text">While most Rebel Aces operate standard vehicles maintained by engineering
                                        crews, a surprising number bring their own private vehicles with them into a fight.
                                        The Rigger doesn't believe in risking his life from the seat of a stock-class anything,
                                        and is always adding, tweaking, and fine-tuning his vehicle not only to achieve the
                                        highest performance, but also to bring unexpected surprises with him to the battlefield.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Considering how outnumbered the Rebels find themselves in almost every
                                        engagement, it is no wonder that some of the Rebel Aces have taken it upon themselves
                                        to increase their survivability by learning about their vehicle. Riggers tend to
                                        have the highest rate of survivability in combat, and their offensive output at the
                                        start of a combat engagement can sometimes end a fight before it begins.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Rigger is fascinated with the golden age of innovation in starship
                                        engineering that exists during the Galactic Civil War. He keeps up to date with the
                                        latest technical journals and even trolls shadowfeeds, following his favorite engineers.
                                        He has a number of friends in the underworld's outlaw tech community, who provide
                                        parts and kits to test on his vehicle of choice. If his ship is somehow blasted and
                                        left adrift, leave it to the Rigger to find some way to get it moving again.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Rigger is resilient in the face of a challenge, and usually turns
                                        to technology to find a solution to most problems he might encounter. The Rigger
                                        believes in his customized ship's ability to outperform any other vessel on the battlefield.
                                        He has painstakingly finetuned it to fly faster and further, hit harder, and take
                                        more punishment than the competition. Despite his impressive ability to mitigate
                                        damage done to his ship, a Rigger is a cautious pilot, and bemoans every dent and
                                        scratch his ship accrues during a battle. If a Rigger finds he is still somehow outgunned,
                                        he can jury-rig a special trick for the enemy on the fly to regain the technological
                                        advantage
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Most every team can benefit from a Rigger within their unit. Riggers
                                        bring a technological expertise that can apply to a variety of circumstances, and
                                        in combat, their vehicles are extremely durable offensive juggernauts. Riggers are
                                        also the only Ace to possess underworld contacts, which can prove useful for supplies,
                                        information, and even allies during missions. The biggest asset a Rigger brings to
                                        a team, though, is the element of surprise. Imperials don't expect an X-wing to have
                                        replaced its astromech slot with a bomb-bayâ€”until the ordnance is already detonating
                                        across their carrier's bridge.</p>

                                                Riggers have a mechanical creativity envied by engineers, and are always

                                                likely worked for a small planetary security force turned resistance in contested
                                                space. These groups were often shorthanded, so personnel were responsible
                                                for maintaining their own craft. The top pilots of the Separatists were often

                                                sharply from standard production models. For the Republic, this practice
                                                was rare outside the Jedi, though toward the end of the Clone Wars, clones
