                                <p class="card-text">With a fraction of the resources and funding of the Empire, the Alliance
                                        is constantly forced to find creative solutions to problems. These problems include
                                        matters of supply, housing, transport, effective weaponry and defenses, and a host
                                        of others. The people they turn to for those creative solutions are those who are
                                        trained and driven to identify a need and seek out a technical solution to it—in
                                        other words, Scientists.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Unsurprisingly, Scientists are among the most educated people in the
                                        galaxy, with a wide range of advanced knowledge in areas such as medicine and celestial
                                        mechanics.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Most Scientists pursue their work in labs, rarely venturing out into
                                        the greater galaxy. Their lives are spent on theories and research, pondering the
                                        latest mysteries of the universe comfortably away from conflict and strife. Some
                                        Scientists, however, seek the satisfaction of bringing their theories and their ideas
                                        into the galaxy in order to help others. They design solutions, help create of the
                                        technology to implement those solutions, and actively test and use those solutions
                                        alongside others who are also trying to help make life better.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Though Alliance officials prefer to keep Scientists in the rear echelons,
                                        as far away from clanger and risk as possible, there are more than a few who insist
                                        on being the ones to test their new devices directly in the held. Further, some Scientists
                                        sign on with the Rebellion for the express purpose of taking the fight to the Empire;
                                        they're just as prepared to fire a blaster at a stormtrooper as they are to devise
                                        a way to improve the power flow for that blaster to do more damage.</p>

                                                and academic Scientists are even more so. Most prefer to assist their local
                                                cells from behind the scenes, passing along scientific information and technology
                                                in an effort to give the Alliance an edge over the Empire. Those rare Scientists

                                                jobs to serve in the Alliance form the core of the loosely organized Rebel
