                                <p class="card-text">Enforcers know that achieving results does not always require violenceâ€”sometimes
                                        the threat of it is enough. Unlike other Hired Guns, Enforcers focus on social interactions
                                        as much as combat. They can handle themselves n a fight, to be sure, but prefer to
                                        accomplish their objectives through savvy, intimidation, blackmail and straightforward
                                        threats. If they need to fight, however, they can brawl with the best.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">While most Hired Guns focus almost exclusively on combat, Enforcers
                                        have a focus in intimidation and both learned and instinctual criminal knowledge.
                                        Although they have access to Brawl and other combat skills, for the most part Enforcers
                                        are not mindless thugs, but canny operators well-versed in the ins and outs of the
                                        criminal underworld. When it comes to navigating this world, few are as knowledgeable
                                        or adept as Enforcers. Even when visiting a new planet, Enforcers adapt quickly,
                                        picking up instinctively on subtle cues and local slang.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">In most criminal organizations, Enforcers fill the dual role of hired
                                        muscle and the "face" of a criminal organization. The Enforcer brings a criminal
                                        syndicate's message to the streets, then ensures that message is followed (and punishes
                                        those who stray). Enforcers should have no trouble finding work, whether on the uncivilized
                                        worlds of the Outer Rim or in the shady underworlds of the Core planets. Enforcers
                                        are a natural fit for organized crime syndicates, where they collect debts and ensure
                                        everyone shows the proper respect and deference to bosses and leaders. Many Enforcers
                                        practice a certain subtlety, avoiding police forces while enforcing the rules of
                                        gangs and criminal organizations.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">While most Enforcers have a fondness for violence, they also display
                                        a degree of self-control. Violence is a tool in the Enforcer's arsenal, and not an
                                        end in itself. Unlike some Hired Gun characters, an Enforcer is more likely to try
                                        words before violence, though these words may be laced with venom and the threat
                                        of imminent violence. However, an Enforcer must always be ready to fight.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">In a group, Enforcers can fulfill much the same combat role as other
                                        Hired Guns, but can also take the lead in negotiations and social interactions. With
                                        their Knowledge (Underworld) and Streetwise skills, Enforcers can act as guides when
                                        the group delves into the criminal underworld, a realm as dangerous for the unprepared
                                        as any natural environment. A savvy Enforcer can actually help the group to avoid
                                        unnecessary fights by knowing what to say during tense negotiations with dangerous
                                        criminals. Enforcers are more likely to take on a social interaction role than some
                                        other Hired Guns, since their skills can be put to use negotiating jobs, finding
                                        work, and managing social encounters.</p>

                                                fame and fortune in the ranks of the criminal underworld, and in that dangerous
                                                culture, could lose it just as easily. A few botched jobs could see an Enforcer
                                                forced to retire, with nothing to fall back on but his strength and experience.
                                                However, an Enforcer would know better than anyone else how mercurial the

                                                they are attempting to avenge an embarrassing slight on their reputation.
                                                For an Enforcer, reputation is central to maintaining an intimidating demeanor.
                                                An opponent who mocks or humiliates him can collapse this reputation and
                                                leave him worthless as an Enforcer. His only chance at salvaging his stature
                                                is to utterly crush his opponent, demonstrating the folly of crossing him.</li>

                                                parent into a life of criminal enterprise. Generally, the role of Enforcer
                                                is fairly low in the criminal hierarchy. Therefore, if the parent was a highly
                                                placed criminal, the character might see his job as a starting level position.
                                                Working as an Enforcer could merely be the first step in a meteoric rise
                                                to the top of a criminal empire.</li>

                                                out as a union organizer or political agitator before circumstances led him
                                                into criminal enterprise. Having to convince and speak to large groups of
                                                people could make him unusually charismatic for an Enforcer, able to rely
                                                on persuasion instead of intimidation. However, if the caricature of a thuggish
                                                union organizer or violenceprone agitator could have applied to the character,
                                                there might be a more straight-forward link between his old life and his
