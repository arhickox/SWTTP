                                <p class="card-text">Sappers have a versatile role in the Alliance. These personnel are responsible
                                        not only for building encampments, installations, landing areas, and more to support
                                        the war against the Empire, but also for seeking out and destroying many of the same
                                        that the enemy possesses. This means these combat Engineers must combine stealth,
                                        survival skills, and situational awareness to find suitable locations and analyze
                                        defensive possibilities, as well as using the same skills to probe for enemy structural
                                        weaknesses that can be exploited with suitable explosives.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Once Sappers find a good location for construction, they must deal with
                                        the logistical demands of supplies. Construction efforts mean they have three bosses
                                        that will never agree: the environment, the laws of physics, and their commander.
                                        Sappers prioritize each differently, and that decision can make or break a construction
                                        project. As with most support jobs, when Sappers do an excellent job, no one notices.
                                        Alliance soldiers don’t give a second thought to a warm bunk and good lighting in
                                        a base, for example, or pilots to a spacious and smooth-floored hangar. If these
                                        aren’t present, however, Sappers get the blame (and also the overnight repair duties).
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Sappers do see battle, perhaps more so than any other support personnel
                                        save medics. Command sends Sappers to sneak up to enemy fortifications to find weaknesses
                                        and entry points. This work often requires a hands-on inspection of the enemy base,
                                        looking for cracks in walls, exposed power lines or sewage pipes, or unattended guard
                                        rotations and resupply schedules. A scouting mission requires stealth or a cover
                                        identity, and Sappers must avoid capture or death from guards or automated security
                                        systems while successfully mapping the enemy’s weak points.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Sappers who survive initial scouting missions must then infiltrate enemy
                                        sites to set explosive charges, carefully cut away security grids, or perform another
                                        act of sabotage, all while avoiding being killed by blaster fire or a mistimed explosive
                                        charge. Even if capture or death is unavoidable, Sappers must press on, as the lives
                                        of many of their comrades depend on their sacrifice.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">After all that, Sappers who survive may still have to pick up a blaster
                                        and join the rest of the soldiers in storming the fortification. Perhaps the operation
                                        went off without a hitch, and the Alliance has provided evac to carry Sapper teams
                                        back to safety. Many refuse to retreat. They can still carry a weapon, and every
                                        body counts in battle. In the end, Sappers risk their lives three times over.

                                                one of two academic backgrounds: military engineering or civil engineering.
                                                Academic military Engineers have taught at one of the many military academies
                                                scattered throughout the galaxy. They combine practical military instruction
                                                and engineering theory to produce combat Engineers who can fight and build
                                                or demolish with equal aplomb. Their civilian counterparts in civil engineering
                                                have taught at one the galaxy’s many colleges and universities, where they
                                                have instructed new Engineers, architects, and urban planners. Their focus
                                                is, obviously, geared more toward constructing and maintaining towns, cities,
                                                and planetary infrastructure for private and governmental entities. <br><br>                                                No
                                                matter where they come from, Sappers with an academic background are incredibly
                                                valuable to the Alliance. As with Saboteurs, the knowledge and skills that
                                                Sappers possess are desperately needed for the war effort. Numerous civilian-
                                                and military-trained Engineers have thrown in their lot with the Rebellion.
                                                Recruiters work day and night to increase those numbers to bulk up the Alliance
                                                military’s engineer corps.

                                                architects or civil Engineers with a penchant for fantastic, often impossible
                                                building designs. They tend to see structures as art first and buildings
                                                second. This can make them forget the human element of their creations, leading
                                                them to make strange decisions regarding proportions, materials, space, and
                                                scale. Fortifications and bases built by eccentric Sappers follow a strange
                                                logic typically understood by the designer alone. While this makes for infuriating
                                                and confusing billets for the troops assigned to these bases, it also makes
                                                such bases extremely difficult to assault or overrun, as they defy most common
                                                rules of layout and design.
