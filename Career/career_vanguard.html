                                <p class="card-text">Vanguards are first to the fight, Soldiers skilled in taking point and
                                        taking charge. While they generally do not command in the traditional sense, their
                                        preferred mode of combat is to hit hard and fast, and thus allies tend to fall in
                                        behind them, if only so that they are not left behind. This means that Vanguards
                                        shoulder a great deal of the risk in battle, but most would rather take a blaster
                                        bolt than let a squadmate be shot. As a result of taking so many hits over the course
                                        of their military careers, the Vanguards who survive tend to be extremely tough.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Having both Cool and Vigilance means that Vanguards are extremely unlikely
                                        to flinch or hesitate when the shots start flying, regardless of whether they are
                                        launching an ambush or reacting to an unexpected move. Athletics reflects the physical
                                        acumen of Vanguards, while Resilience stems from the long history of hits such characters
                                        have likely taken.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">On battlefields often dominated by massive walkers, sudden starfighter
                                        strikes, and orbital bombardments, standing still in the open can be a death sentence,
                                        and Vanguards know it. Rather than hunkering down and hoping to avoid the worst,
                                        Vanguards take the battle directly to the enemy, seizing the initiative to end the
                                        battle before their foes even realize that it has begun. They tend to favor rapid
                                        strikes, armored assaults, and shipboard actions that leave the enemy reeling and
                                        unable to bring its armor to bear. So long as they keep moving, their logic goes,
                                        the enemy cannot hope to pin them down. Barriers to their entry, from blast doors
                                        to bunkers, are something to be smashed so that they can move on to the next target.
                                        The Moving Target talent is particularly useful when keeping mobile to stay alive,
                                        and makes a Vanguard with the drop on the enemy extremely difficult to bring down.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Off the field of battle, Vanguards are frequently quick to action as
                                        well. Hesitation on the battlefield is often fatal, and many Vanguards apply this
                                        mentality to their other activities, trying to keep opponents on their back feet
                                        no matter the arena. While this can make them combative, it can also be useful to
                                        a group of rebel agents, whether they are negotiating for supplies, trying to persuade
                                        others to the cause, or attempting to maintain a bluff. A Vanguard is likely to see
                                        the importance of momentum in any field and press the advantage whenever possible.</p>

                                                abandon. In many cases, their grief has clouded their judgment, leaving them
                                                only with a thirst for revenge. Still, over time, protecting their new allies
                                                becomes just as important to them as taking out Imperials.</li>

                                                naive recruits, unaware of their own mortality, and eager to display their
                                                bravery and protect their friends. Most of these reckless warriors are from
                                                the Rimâ€™s cities, where the brash youth have a chip on their shoulder and
                                                want to prove their courage. Such recruits always want to go first and take

                                                or perhaps even members of the dreaded Imperial Royal Guard. These high-level
                                                defections often come with Imperial death marks, and many take extra measures
                                                to fake their own deaths before departing. In the highest profile cases,
                                                the Empire often covers up the defection to avoid embarrassment.</li>

                                                and such groups often have Vanguards at their front. War leaves orphans,
                                                deserters, and other disenfranchised individuals in its wake, and no few
                                                groups of guns for hire form around such survivors. With few skills besides

                                                with the Imperial takeover of the Republic after the Clone Wars, these veterans
                                                might seek a return to democracy. Other Vanguards might have been members
