                                <p class="card-text">On or above the ground, the Driver becomes a part of the machine he
                                        drives, and he attempts maneuvers no design engineer ever intended his vehicle to
                                        do. Most Drivers are handy with a hydrospanner, and able to maintain their vehiclesâ€”which
                                        is a good thing, considering how much abuse their toys take.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Mastery of his machines is a primary focus for a Driver. In addition,
                                        so many things can go wrong on a planet, especially when piloting a vehicle at insane
                                        speeds, that being prepared for the worst is a major part of training for most Drivers.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Most Drivers are well aware they never get the glory or thanks a starhghter
                                        pilot does, but it rarely matters. The bite of atmosphere on the wings or the feel
                                        of every bump and groove on the road speaks to them in ways the vacuum of space never
                                        could. The sheer variety of vehicles a Driver can control on a planet is a huge draw,
                                        each representing yet another opportunity to push a machine to its limits and beyond.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Within the Alliance, Drivers are highly valued, both for their capacity
                                        to get the most out of the limited planetary combat vehicles available as well as
                                        for their knack for keeping such machines in one piece (or at least limited number
                                        of pieces). In most cases, commanders in the Rebellion know to give a Driver a destination
                                        and a goal, and then to get out of the way and let him figure out the best way to
                                        get there and get it done.</p>
