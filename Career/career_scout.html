                                <p class="card-text">There's finding a planet, and then there's going down to the planet
                                        and seeing what's what. The Scout is the professional for the task, trained to survey
                                        and survive, gathering all of the information he can while keeping his head attached
                                        to his body. While bravery in combat is one thing, there can be no denying the fearlessness
                                        of anyone willing to touch down on a completely unknown planet and trudge about with
                                        only scanners and his wits to discover its secrets.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Scout knows his way around in any environment, and he's both tough and
                                        knowledgeable enough to make the most of his situation. Most Scouts are skilled at:
                                        covering any ground (or lack thereof); how to find what to eat and where to sleep;
                                        and how to survey an area and gather all the needed data. Scouts are often excellent
                                        at driving or piloting atmospheric craft as well.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">There are plenty of Scouts that work either for the Empire or for corporations
                                        that actively seek out and survey planets for possible exploitation. They normally
                                        work with survey teams with excellent support and resources. Independent Scouts—like
                                        the one a player is likely to play—operate with a great deal more autonomy. They
                                        will find smaller operations to work with, ones with looser rules and regulations
                                        that let them operate more as they choose. Living by his toughness and wits as he
                                        must, a Scout will be surprisingly effective in most situations. After all, adapting
                                        to the unknown is a trademark talent of any Scout.</p>

                                                read about and to discover newer, more interesting, results. The wise Scout

                                                these activities can get a Scout into a great deal of trouble and possibly
                                                hunted by Imperial Inteligence. Then there are Scouts who, while working
                                                for one employer, sell the information they've discovered to other factions.
                                                That kind of double-dealing can lead to all manner of legal trouble.</li>

                                                entrepreneurial, but they can be in a unique position to offer services not
                                                readily available from others. Often the first ones to see a planet, asteroid,
                                                or other stellar phenomenon, Scouts can levy such discoveries into highly
                                                lucrative opportunities. A Scout setting out on his own might do well for
                                                himself by putting a good team together, finding out what factions and corporations
                                                are looking for in the way of planetary resources, and endeavoring to find
                                                such assets. As large as the galaxy is, the pool to search from is nearly
                                                infinite.</li>

                                                influence of the most powerful entity in the galaxy. Working under the constant
                                                interference of Imperial bureaucrats chafes too much for some, or they may
                                                decide too many policies and strictures make their service miserable to perform.
                                                Sometimes, a Scout comes across a planet where terrible atrocities are being
                                                committed in the name of the Emperor; such an accidental discovery may well
                                                drive him to make his way into the galactic frontier to disappear.</li>

                                                backgrounds, but it's entirely possible a displaced aristocrat might find
                                                himself with a ship and an education in planetology. The right knowledge
                                                and resources may well lead him to the life of a Scout, and the general solitude
                                                and avoidance of cities and civilization (where he is more likely to be recognized
                                                by those he'd rather avoid) can be appealing for a fallen noble. Further,
                                                the life of a Scout may enable a noble to regain some of what he's lost,
                                                either by discovering vastly valuable resources or even laying claim to a
                                                planet upon which to build his own dynasty.</li>

                                                the piloting and other skill sets that are ideal to a Scout. Clearly, someone
                                                of that mind-set is well suited to a life of always moving on to the next
