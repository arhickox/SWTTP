                                <p class="card-text">There comes a time in the life of most who feel the draw of the Force
                                        when they decide that they can best serve the galaxy by passing along the accumulated
                                        knowledge and wisdom of their lifetime. Whether they have been classically trained
                                        in one of the ancient disciplines, have pursued a more mundane education in an academy
                                        or conservatory, or are self-taught through innate discipline and drive, Teachers
                                        now seek to assist others in gaining the training and enlightenment they have accrued.
                                        Through the efforts of Teachers, their allies can attain greater abilities and assets
                                        than they would have alone.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Given their selection of skills, Teachers will be far better at enhancing
                                        the potential of their group than any other Consular. In addition to providing valuable
                                        assistance to their companions, Teachers are more than capable of holding their own
                                        in almost any situation. They can pursue a wide range of skills and abilities with
                                        an eye toward passing this knowledge along to others. Teachers feel the presence
                                        of the Force throughout their life and will feel the draw of many paths through the
                                        years. Through this process, they will accumulate a vast store of knowledge and experience.
                                        Many reach a point where the drive to push on is overcome by the desire to pass on
                                        their knowledge to others, to better serve the galaxy.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Some Teachers work closely with established schools and academies, perhaps
                                        echoing the techniques and traditions of the fallen Jedi Temple. Many of these work
                                        in the Outer Rim, far from the prying eyes of the Galactic Empire. Others, feeling
                                        no need for more advanced aids and accoutrements, content themselves with little
                                        more than a clearing or a log to sit their pupils upon, from which they might contemplate
                                        the mysteries of the galaxy together. Teachers are often keenly aware of their place
                                        in the scheme of life and seek to pass the peace and assurance of this knowledge
                                        on to their students, that their students may better serve their own purposes. No
                                        matter the particular goal of the moment, a Teacher will have advice and instruction
                                        to assist in its achievement.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">In the course of a lifetime, any setting can turn into a classroom with
                                        a willing Teacher on one side and an apt pupil on the other. Whether in a dry, dusty
                                        hut in the middle of a desert, the sodden expanse of a humid swamp, or the cramped
                                        confines of a tramp freighter, Teachers will do what is needed to see that their
                                        students are prepared for the tasks that lie before them.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Often the path of the Teacher is not one that is selected, but one that
                                        is thrust upon one by circumstance. In the pursuit of expansive goals, it may be
                                        hard to realize that it is best left to others to achieve them, the responsibilbity
                                        of the Teacher being to assist them and shepherd them along. Having a Teacher in
                                        a group can be a great boon no matter the goal, given the versatility of Teachers
                                        abilities and their capacity to assist other members of their group in any efforts
                                        they may make. When the need is greatest and a new generation must rise to lB confront
                                        the darkness, there can be no greater ally in the Force than knowledge passed down
                                        from the vantage of experience and understanding.

                                                probably saved their life. Many Teachers see their “failure” as a second

                                                who are willing to learn. This makes it difficult for them to remain hidden

                                                It cannot be touched in any physical sense, so sometimes a Teacher will seek
                                                out objects from the past and use them to convey otherwise difficult concepts
                                                to those who wish to learn the ways of the Force. These instructors recognize
                                                that such relics bring their lessons to life and must be preserved. Holocrons
