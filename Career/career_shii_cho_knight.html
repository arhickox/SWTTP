                                <p class="card-text">The ancient lightsaber fighting style of Shii-Cho is said to be the
                                        first lightsaber form taught to the Jedi and their predecessors. It focuses on the
                                        essentials of saber fighting and borrows heavily from other sword fighting techniques.
                                        Appropriately, the modern practitioners of this form focus on perfecting the core
                                        tenants of sword fighting, recognizing the strength of simplicity. Shii-Cho Knights
                                        eschew fancy maneuvers, preferring to focus on the fundamentals of block, parry,
                                        and strike.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Shii-Cho Knight's skills provide them with a solid grounding in
                                        the core techniques of any physical conflict. They are familiar with the weapon they
                                        wield, but they are also very comfortable exploiting their natural athleticism and
                                        flexibility. Because of this, they can not only avoid an enemyâ€™s attack, but also
                                        make certain that they are able to strike effectively when their target is at a disadvantage.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Followers of this path are seldom concerned with personal appearances
                                        or the style that they exhibit in a conflict. Instead, they are focused on precision
                                        and on achieving their ultimate goal of victory. For them, a solid grounding in the
                                        basics is something they can rely on in any situation. When lives are on the line,
                                        they devote their attention to executing their maneuvers in a traditional way, using
                                        them to counter an opponent while simultaneously restricting his options.</p>

                                                to follow the old Jedi codes and eschew vengeance. However, those trained
                                                in ancient arts and philosophies are not immune to tragedy. This character
                                                may have lost a master who spoke against vengeance, now finding the philosophy
                                                difficult to follow in the face of reality. Possibly conflicted, this Shii-Cho
                                                Knight tries to justify avenging those struck down unjustly, seeking more
                                                than merely personal vengeance.

                                                stories of Jedi in such a way that the character considers taking up causes
                                                and fighting for change integral to the Jedi path. Jedi once policed the
                                                galaxy, and this character wishes to carry on their good work. This Shii-Cho
                                                Knight seeks out the sort of injustices Jedi once fought against, freeing
                                                slaves, rescuing innocent prisoners, and liberating whole planets if possible.

                                                Shii-Cho Knight, but if fighting for credits enables the character to survive
                                                to do great things, then getting paid is a necessary evil. Everyone has to
                                                eat, weapons cost money, and even a Force user must admit that credits are
                                                a form of power in the galaxy, however distasteful that may seem. This Shii-Cho
                                                Knight may be careful where the credits come from, but they are realistic
                                                about the necessity of payment.

                                                that emphasizes melee combat. A Jedi survivor might have spotted the young
