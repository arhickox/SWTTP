                                <p class="card-text">Far from the civilized parts of the galaxy, there are many predators
                                        that can endanger sentient life. Some of these are animals that prey upon anything
                                        digestible. Others are malicious and twisted individuals who enjoy a savage and bloodthirsty
                                        existence. Hunters are Force adepts who are uniquely capable of tracking, confronting,
                                        and slaying these creatures, particularly those who hide in the wilds, far from civilization.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Hunters need to be able to sneak up on their targets, move through difficult
                                        terrain, and be constantly alert to their surroundings. Many hunters train with ranged
                                        weapons so that they can strike their targets from far away.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Most Hunters initially embark upon their careers focused on animal prey.
                                        Few, however, engage in this practice out of a desire to prove their mettle or a
                                        thirst for blood. Rather, their connection to the Force often lets them differentiate
                                        between predators that hunt out of necessity from those that are actively malicious.
                                        A Hunter does not normally interfere in the natural cycle of life, but he’s more
                                        than willing to restore balance by eliminating a predator that kills needlessly and
                                        destroys natural habitats. Sadly, these foul and twisted animalistic intelligences
                                        also have their parallels within sentient beings. All too often, a Hunter finds himself
                                        hunting intelligent quarry; this can prove to be the most dangerous game of all.</p>

                                                may be. They rarely deal with savage beasts, the full brunt of deadly storms,
                                                or the need to find a safe haven in an unforgiving landscape. For those brought

                                                lives. This longtime expertise can compensate for a lack of familiarity with
                                                more advanced techniques and technologies, or it can complement such tools

                                                with some of the most dangerous life forms in the galaxy. Sometimes this
                                                is by choice, as they seek ever-greater challenges to use in perfecting their
                                                skills. In other cases, Hunters face these threats because they must protect
                                                their homes or friends on particularly deadly worlds. And of course, some
                                                Hunters just have a knack for flushing out trouble. Whatever the reason for
