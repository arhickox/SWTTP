                                <p class="card-text">Some individuals are able to remain constantly aware of the Force’s
                                        presence, even as they go about their daily lives. They recognize its influence in
                                        the subtlest of ways. For them, minor ripples in the Force reveal deep meanings and
                                        forewarn of critical events far in the future. Elowever, this quantity of information—particularly
                                        in environments filled with other sentients—can become overwhelming. Because of this,
                                        many who follow the path of the Seer choose to live lives of relative isolation,
                                        far from crowded towns and cities.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Successful Seers must be able to maintain focus on daily life even as
                                        they also observe the Force, They must learn to recognize a broad range of subtle
                                        signs. They must also be prepared to dwell in a potentially hostile environment,
                                        apart from civilization, so that they can be spared from information overload.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Among Force-sensitive individuals, Seers are arguably the ones who feel
                                        the strongest sense of guidance from the Force. Dwelling within the Force at all
                                        times, they can recognize even minor ripples and follow them to their source to stop
                                        a small problem from turning into a major crisis. Similarly, they may recognize an
                                        event that occurs far away and advise those nearby to take action so they can be
                                        prepared well in advance of an upcoming crisis. Seers’ abilities often give them
                                        insights into the future, guiding them to places and people who most need their wisdom
                                        and advice. This sometimes enables Seers to be in just the right place at the right
                                        time to take action that proves to be pivotal.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The challenge for many Seers is to know the best time to move into a
                                        civilized area. As their sensitivity can become muddled, they may miss a sign of
                                        great import. Consequently, some prefer to remain apart from society for as long
                                        as possible, depending on allies to carry their missives. Seldom, however, are others
                                        capable of communicating a warning as effectively as the Seer who initially sensed
                                        the danger.</p>

                                                but words failed to convey the true meaning. This turned into a process of
                                                writing and editing that seemed endless, frustrating, and pointless. These
                                                writers and poets scribed long polemics eviscerating tyrants or oppressive
                                                systems, works of fiction that had a deep seed of truth, or manifestos urging
                                                people to rise up. When these writers managed to overcome their own paranoia
                                                and fears, they found themselves with a renewed purpose as Seers.

                                                such as archaeologists, scientists, and reporters. All of these augurs shared
                                                an instinctive feeling that the current, common knowledge didn’t tell the
                                                full story. Archaeologists dug to reveal a lost past, scientists experimented
                                                and observed to find a hidden principle, and reporters researched and interviewed
                                                to find an unspoken narrative. It takes very little for augurs to become

                                                They researched, argued with academics, and bothered experts, all in search

                                                up the flow. When they compiled this knowledge, they saw potential futures

                                                and balances. A bit removed from day-to-day politics, they came from academia
                                                or governmental analysis groups, or were self-educated intellectuals. They
                                                were all united by a common ability: they were able to forecast how a set
