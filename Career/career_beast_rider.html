                                <p class="card-text">Many worlds in the galaxy are too backward, too poor, or have environments
                                        too extreme to support modern vehicles. Sometimes, instead of spending credits to
                                        adapt a speeder to the cold or create a filter that can keep sand out of a repulsordrive,
                                        it is simply easier to use a native mount that has evolved and adapted to local conditions
                                        for untold millennia.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">While most any being can ride a trained mount, it is the Beast Rider
                                        who can break in wild mounts and train them. Once he has trained a mount, the skilled
                                        Beast Rider can coax his mount to perform incredible feats, even in the heat of battle.
                                        The Beast Rider is also something of an outdoorsman, and is a valuable member of
                                        a team with or without his creature companion.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Beast Riders might be expert riders on a single type of mount or experienced
                                        creature wranglers who have spent time with all manner of riding creatures. Most
                                        cultures and militaries, despite the broader reliance on modern machinery, still
                                        rely heavily on mounts. The Imperials ride lizard-like dewbacks on desert worlds
                                        like Tatooine, while the Rebels famously saddled up tauntauns on Hoth. Indigenous
                                        cultures throughout the galaxy depend on Beast Riders, including the bantha-obsessed
                                        Tusken Raiders of Tatooine and the ruping riders of Onderon.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Unlike their fellow Aces, the Beast Rider is at home outdoors, where
                                        he can feel the wind on his face. He fits in just as well with the soldiers and scouts
                                        of the Rebel Army as with his fellow Aces in starfighters and speeders.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Rebellion often assigns Beast Riders as scouts at Rebel bases and
                                        outposts, conducting patrols and setting up advance defenses and other contingency
                                        measures to prepare for potential Imperial discovery. When an Imperial or one of
                                        his allies spots creature tracks, he might think it belongs to a wild creatureâ€”whereas,
                                        if he sees vehicle tracks, he is very likely to investigate. In battle, mounted cavalry
                                        might not be quite as fast, agile, or heavily armed and armored as its mechanized
                                        counterparts, but it has several advantages. Creature mounts have better camouflage,
                                        more mobility in close quarters, and in battle, Imperial vehicles often ignore them
                                        outright.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Most groups can benefit from a Beast Rider in their ranks. The Beast
                                        Rider is second only to the Spy career's Scout specialization in matters of wilderness
                                        survival and guerrilla warfare. His ability to traverse difficult terrain, capture
                                        and train indigenous mounts, and locate food and shelter are critical to a number
                                        of Rebel mission profiles. Further, should a team member crash land, or otherwise
                                        become stranded, a Beast Rider might be critical to their very survival.</p>

                                                are often troopers trained as mounted cavalry. These specialized troops ride
                                                various types of mounts throughout their training, so that they can take
                                                the reins of any mount, be it the ray-like thranta, the reptilian dewback,
                                                or an insectoid lava flea. For the most part, mounted cavalry is reserved
