                                <p class="card-text">Plenty of folks know how to fly a starship, but a Smuggler who specializes
                                        as a Pilot develops a relationship with his ship, and it becomes an extension of
                                        his wit and his will. He can make a plodding old transport run far above its performance
                                        ratings, and given time and some modifications, he can turn it into one of the fleetest
                                        and most maneuverable craft ever to take to the stars. A Pilot's talents further
                                        reinforce his dominance in the cockpit.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Pilot is another specialization that rarely leads to unemployment. If
                                        a Pilot doesn't already have his own ship (and the inevitable Obligation that goes
                                        with it), he will likely be able to sign on with any number of groups, criminal or
                                        otherwise. Once he establishes his competency at the controls, he'll be able to get
                                        some fairly choice assignments. A Player Character Pilot will be considered indispensable
                                        to his group, especially after the first space battle or ship-related crisis.</p>
