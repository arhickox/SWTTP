                                <p class="card-text">Virtually no Alliance military unit can function without a competent
                                        Mechanic, due to the constant wear-andtear on the mechanical and technical assets
                                        the unit relies upon to do battle. Mechanics do everything from minor tune-ups and
                                        adjustments to massive overhauls and repairs. They are both the gears of the Alliance
                                        machine and the grease that makes it run smoothly.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Tough and pragmatic, Mechanics tend to be able to take care of themselves
                                        in a fight, and they know the best places to get what they need when normal supply
                                        chains fail. They're also usually capable of flying or driving whatever they fix.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Most Mechanics are definitely "in the field" types. While they prefer
                                        to have a good place to work where they can keep their tools, they don't want to
                                        be too far away from the unit they support to do any good. A military- minded Mechanic
                                        always has a solid, portable kit for his tools and is ready to go into the line of
                                        fire to get a desperately needed tank or heavy cannon back up and running before
                                        the enemy overruns the position.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Many Alliance commanders are loath to promote their Mechanics, but this
                                        isn't due to a lack of confidence in a Mechanic's abilities or a failure to follow
                                        orders (though Mechanics in the Rebellion do have a reputation for being a surly,
                                        independent lot). Instead, such commanders fear that promotion will lead to their
                                        unit's loss of the service of a highly valued member of the team. Fortunately, most
                                        Mechanics have little use for rank, and even less use for the paperwork and bureaucracy
                                        that upper-echelon types have to deal with. They'd much rather take wrench in hand
                                        and get to work.</p>

                                                and vocational schools. These hardy individuals paid their dues in the shops,
                                                garages, and grease pits, and decided to use their expertise to teach new
                                                generations of gearheads how to properly care for the array of machines that
                                                keep the galaxy running. Instead of turning wrenches for a living, they toiled
                                                away in dingy teaching garages or high-tech academies, guiding the educations
                                                of eager young Mechanics. <br><br> The Alliance is always in desperate need
                                                for Mechanics. The old, secondhand, and usually poorly cared-for ships, vehicles,
                                                and gear the Rebels use need an immense amount of work to keep running. To
                                                ensure that the Y-wings keep flying and the blaster rifles and com-links
                                                keep working, Rebel cells heavily recruit among academic Mechanics. Their
                                                knowledge and experience is in high demand, and the Alliance pays a pretty
                                                credit to lure them into the fold.

                                                pushing vehicles to, and often beyond, the very limit of their tolerances.
