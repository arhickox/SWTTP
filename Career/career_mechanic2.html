                <div class="card career-text-card">
                        <div class="card-body">
                                <p class="card-text">Virtually no Alliance military unit can function without a competent
                                        Mechanic, due to the constant wear-andtear on the mechanical and technical assets
                                        the unit relies upon to do battle. Mechanics do everything from minor tune-ups and
                                        adjustments to massive overhauls and repairs. They are both the gears of the Alliance
                                        machine and the grease that makes it run smoothly.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Tough and pragmatic, Mechanics tend to be able to take care of themselves
                                        in a fight, and they know the best places to get what they need when normal supply
                                        chains fail. They're also usually capable of flying or driving whatever they fix.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Most Mechanics are definitely "in the field" types. While they prefer
                                        to have a good place to work where they can keep their tools, they don't want to
                                        be too far away from the unit they support to do any good. A military- minded Mechanic
                                        always has a solid, portable kit for his tools and is ready to go into the line of
                                        fire to get a desperately needed tank or heavy cannon back up and running before
                                        the enemy overruns the position.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Many Alliance commanders are loath to promote their Mechanics, but this
                                        isn't due to a lack of confidence in a Mechanic's abilities or a failure to follow
                                        orders (though Mechanics in the Rebellion do have a reputation for being a surly,
                                        independent lot). Instead, such commanders fear that promotion will lead to their
                                        unit's loss of the service of a highly valued member of the team. Fortunately, most
                                        Mechanics have little use for rank, and even less use for the paperwork and bureaucracy
                                        that upper-echelon types have to deal with. They'd much rather take wrench in hand
                                        and get to work.</p>
