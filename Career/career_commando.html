                                <p class="card-text">Commandos are specialists trained to strike the enemy from unexpected
                                        directions to do the most damage in the most vulnerable locations. Commando teams
                                        are often used like surgical instruments by the commanders who have access to them.
                                        A Commando knows how to find a target, attack it, disable it, survive the aftermath,
                                        and find his way home. Commandos are masters of close combat and surviving in all
                                        conditions. They are usually good at sneaking past enemy guards and listening posts
                                        as well.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">For any team, a Commando is a fine general-purpose combat specialist
                                        to have around. He handles fights well (especially hand-to-hand situations), and
                                        can manage in almost any high-stress situation. More often than not, he's also effective
                                        as backup during covert operations. Matters of overall philosophy or strategy rarely
                                        concern a Commando; he's almost always focused on the mission at hand or training
                                        to ensure he and his companions survive the next one.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">As stand-up confrontations are normally a losing proposition for the
                                        Alliance, the Commandos are some of the most important and effective soldiers fighting
                                        for the Rebellion. Their capacity to surgically strike at Imperial targets, as well
                                        as their value as guards and support personnel for other specialists operating on
                                        behalf of the Alliance, makes any single one of them worth more than a platoon of
                                        stormtroopers.

                                                often need to prove themselves first, but the Rebel Alliance has a number
                                                of commando training programs for those that show promise. The up-close and
                                                grisly nature of what commandos do makes it a difficult task for most young,
                                                inexperienced recruits. A rare amount of detachment and determination is

                                                these former storm commandos have since been able to recruit like-minded

                                                prefer the company of fellow former Imperials, rebel commando training makes
