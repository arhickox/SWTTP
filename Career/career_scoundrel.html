                                <p class="card-text">Part con artist, part gunslinger, and part cantina brawler, the Scoundrel
                                        is quick-witted, quick on his feet, and quick to get himself into a great deal of
                                        trouble at the drop of a hat. He doesn't care one whit for rules or laws, except
                                        where he can use them to work an angle that either nets him a lot of credits or brings
                                        down an enemy. If he's really lucky—and he tends to have an unshakable faith in his
                                        luck—he'll manage both. His combination of skills and talents make him formidable
                                        in a fight, useful in dealing with the underworld, and an individual simply not to
                                        be trusted.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Scoundrels fulfill many roles in the Outer Rim. Some are grifters, others
                                        are middle-men, and still others are simply thrill-seekers looking to see what they
                                        can get into next. Scoundrels tend to avoid taking charge of anything, but they are
                                        more than willing to ride the coattails of powerful people, often applying their
                                        unique skill set to help their employer in any number of ways. Scoundrels rarely
                                        put down roots for very long, and will always be looking for the next interesting
                                        thing to do (especially if it can make them some money).</p>
                                <p class="card-text">In a Player Character group, the Scoundrel is a kind of all-purpose
                                        character. He's got enough underworld savvy and social ability to act as a "face"
                                        for the group, and he's no slouch in a fight. He may or may not be a pilot, but it's
                                        almost certain he's got many of the rogue-style abilities a group might need.</p>

                                                and regulations. They might have stayed long enough to gain some weapons

                                                because it suited them at the time. For a Scoundrel, trade is trade, and

                                                on a larger scale. Perhaps he witnessed the Empire’s cruelty close-up, and
                                                now fights injustice and causes trouble for the Empire whenever he can.</li>

                                                may have grown up on a lawless planet, perhaps in close proximity to some
