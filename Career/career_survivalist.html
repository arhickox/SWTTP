                                        places where few (if any) sentients have ever trodden the ground. Places like these
                                        are ideal hiding places for those fleeing the law or retribution for their actions.
                                        Places like these are where Bounty Hunters who specialize as Survivalists thrive.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Survivalist's skill set harkening back to the ancient practices
                                        of true wilderness hunters. With his talent array, he can keep himself and his companions
                                        alive, and he knows where and what to look for when searching for just about anything
                                        or anyone. He's also gifted at hunting any kind of target.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Not everything that happens in the galaxy occurs in cities or out in
                                        space. In fact, most of the habitable places of the galaxy are rural or wilderness
                                        in nature. A specialization in Survivalist ensures a character has the necessary
                                        knowledge and training to make his way in such environments, and help the far more
                                        urban-minded folks he's likely traveling with.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Despite their capacity to live off the land, Survivalists enjoy credits
                                        and the things that can be purchased with them just like anyone else. They will often
                                        look to hire themselves out to customers who need their expertise in seeking out
                                        (or hunting) something beyond the duracrete and tapcafs.</p>

                                                of bounty hunters for whom money might seem largely a secondary
                                                concern. They spend their time far away from civilization-traipsing through the trackless 
                                                edges of the galaxy, carrying only what they need to perform their job,
                                                surviving on very little—and live almost ascetic lives.
                                                Their bounties are found in mountaintop hermitages
                                                amid screaming blizzards, deep beneath caustic oceans of far-flung, abandoned worlds, and in countless places
                                                where civilization does not or cannot reach. In these forsaken places, hunting desperate fugitives, the only thing
                                                standing between life and death is a hunter’s training
                                                and survival gear. Conditioning the body to withstand
                                                hostile conditions and making a study of the ways to
                                                survive in such places are lifelong pursuits and cost no
                                                small amount of credits. No mere training can keep a
                                                hunter from freezing to death on a mountainside, however. 
                                                Survival gear is also shockingly expensive, especially when it is custom-made for specific uses. When a
                                                slim survival pack costs more than the purchase price
                                                of a new starship, it is easy to see why these hardy freelancers might be concerned with money.

                                                to a deep-seated belief in the sacrosanctity of nature.

                                                nature, and took to bounty hunting when it was threatened. Whether a region is protected by law or merely
                                                in need of such defense, these bounty hunters are the
