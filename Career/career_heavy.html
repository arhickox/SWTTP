                                <p class="card-text">For a Heavy, size really does matter. These characters prefer to use
                                        the biggest guns possible, and usually have the physique to match. Heavies are often
                                        physically impressive, a necessity for effectively wielding the heaviest manportable
                                        weapons. Heavies are inevitably found at the front in combat, as allies back away
                                        and give them space.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Their straightforward list of skills allows a Heavy to do primarily
                                        one thing: wield large, dangerous weapons. From heavy blasters to missile tubes,
                                        Heavies favor big, loud, and devastating weaponry. Using such weapons is often punishing
                                        for the wielder, and characters must possess great fortitude in order to wield such
                                        weapons extensively. A high Resilience skill is often a side effect of the Heavy's
                                        actions, rather than the result of conscious training. Lugging around heavy weapons
                                        builds stamina, and simply dealing with the recoil provides a workout.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Heavies generally approach combat in the most direct way possible—stealth
                                        and duplicity are not becoming of a walking arsenal. Similarly, Heavies tend to be
                                        very straightforward in their dealings. This bluntness sometimes comes across as
                                        a lack of intellect, though few would be brave enough to say so to the Heavy's face.
                                        There may be some truth to the perception that Heavies sacrifice brains for brawn,
                                        but as with all generalizations, there are many exceptions. In a galaxy of double-crosses
                                        and altered deals, steadfastness and blunt honesty can be seen as virtues.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">While some Heavies may work as independent operators, most find themselves
                                        as a permanent addition to a group. Heavies can easily find a place among a mercenary
                                        band. Having a Heavy in a group is a great boon. The mere sight of the heavy weapons
                                        they carry can ensure that no one hassles them, and a single Heavy—when properly
                                        equipped—is easily a match for numerous foes.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">In a Player Character group, a Heavy fulfills a similar role to that
                                        of a light battle tank in a military force. Heavies can often deal out enough damage
                                        to wipe out entire groups of enemies single-handedly, and are also typically able
                                        to absorb a great deal of punishment. Heavies must have a high Brawn in order to
                                        wield heavy, cumbersome weapons, which helps them to shrug off damage, and also allows
                                        them to wear heavy armor that may be too encumbering for other characters. A Heavy's
                                        skills and talents are narrowly focused, but they make him a master of ranged combat.</p>

                                                set, so it's what they put their skill set toward that made them heroes.
                                                A Heavy who used to be famous might have been a war hero, perhaps honored
                                                for a single heroic act such as holding a battle line against hordes of enemies
                                                or destroying an enemy walker with a single well-placed shot. However, beyond
                                                his skill or luck on the field of battle, the Heavy had nothing else that
                                                made him heroic, and might have possessed vices or personality flaws that
                                                made him a poor hero in the public eye. Quickly cast down from the pedestal,
                                                the character could be understandably bitter at the unexpected whims that
                                                saw him rise and fall.</li>

                                                force did so as gunnery specialists for artillery or walkers, or with crew-served
                                                weapons such as heavy blasters. However, a Heavy could have just as easily
                                                been a gunner on a warship. Turbolasers and proton torpedoes are very different
                                                from shoulder-mounted missile launchers or flechette launchers, but for some,
                                                the thrill of firing the big guns is the same. In addition, there are some
                                                basic similarities between using one weapon and another, so the transition
                                                from Navy officer to Heavy is very possible.</li>

                                                the course for veneance could be infinitely varied, but how he plans to deliver
                                                reprisal might tie directly into his particular set of weapon skills. If
                                                the goal is simply to avenge himself through killing, this should not be
                                                too difficult. However, if the character decides that death is too easy for
                                                a hated foe, he'll have to think creatively as to how to use his particular
                                                skills when fulfilling the vendetta.</li>

                                                specialization, the Heavy could just have likely gone into their singular

                                                to match their parents' fame and renown, even if they can't duplicate it.</li>

                                                These attributes are also key for the Heavy, and a former miner might bring
