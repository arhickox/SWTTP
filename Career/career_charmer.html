                <div class="card career-text-card">
                        <div class="card-body">
                                <p class="card-text">Confident and elegant, the Charmer employs his wits and wiles with more
                                        precision than a laser scalpel. Rather than resorting to uncivilized intimidation
                                        tactics or distasteful acts of violence, the Charmer believes the best way to get
                                        what he wants is to simply ask for it. A Charmer knows how to talk the talk, possessing
                                        natural charisma that makes him irresistible. Struck by the flash of his smile or
                                        the wink of his eye, people have a hard time denying anything to the Charmer.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Charmer combines the silver tongue of a Politico, the street smarts
                                        of a Scoundrel, and the keen mind of a Trader. Where the Politico might rally, chastise,
                                        or even bribe to achieve his objective, the Charmer showers his mark with flattery.
                                        While the Trader relies on his ability to haggle down a price, the Charmer convinces
                                        others that lowering the price is their idea. When a Scoundrel resorts to coercion
                                        and violence, a Charmer applies a softer touch to disarm his opponents with words
                                        alone.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">The chief weapon in a Charmer’s arsenal is clearly his undeniable charisma.
                                        When coaxing his way into a private club or restricted area, the Charmer knows how
                                        to compliment without sounding sycophantic. In rare cases when his debonair appearance
                                        and refined taste fails him, the Charmer knows how to resort to negotiation and trickery
                                        to get his way, doing so with his own smooth brand of flair and style. The Charmer
                                        keeps a cool head in the hottest situations, which often serves as inspiration to
                                        others, and he has no qualms with taking a leadership role if it furthers his purposes.
                                        Whether or not he knows the right thing to say, the Charmer always knows how to say
                                        it.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Despite all his silvered words, the Charmer is no gilded flower. When
                                        all else fails, if the Charmer cannot diffuse the situation before it escalates,
                                        or cannot convince others to fight in his place, the Charmer holds his own in combat.
                                        In a fight, the Charmer can cause opponents to doubt their motives and lower their
                                        guard. The Charmer’s Smuggler career gives him the knowledge to navigate the underworld,
                                        the ability to escape a jail cell, and the skill to steal a starship for a quick
                                        getaway.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">A Smuggler who chooses Charmer as his specialization is an exceptional
                                        choice for nearly any campaign. His emphasis on social interaction makes the Charmer
                                        handy in any intrigue-oriented campaign, but his Smuggler fundamentals and ability
                                        to negotiate with merchants, distract would-be attackers, or diffuse combat encounters
                                        make him a welcome addition to underworld- or combat-focused campaigns as well.</p>

                                                people through manipulation. The Charmer’s social savvy is his most valuable

                                                record, though, and then fate might compel a Charmer to turn to smuggling.</li>
