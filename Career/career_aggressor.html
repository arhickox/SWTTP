                                <p class="card-text">The Aggressor relies on fear to intimidate his opposition into surrender
                                        or retreat. Aggressors tend to be tough and dangerous combatants, able to dish out
                                        brutal damage to anyone who fights them, while surviving the same. They use their
                                        confident, terrifying attitudes to convey this to their opponents. Some Aggressors
                                        hope their enemies back down without a fight, but others fall into the trap of relishing
                                        the fear they inspire.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Their skills enable Aggressors to recognize the bravado shown by criminal
                                        enforcers and thugs. It also aids them in cowing these individuals, assuring these
                                        predators that the Force-sensitive character is a far scarier and more potent individual
                                        than they have previously faced.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Tempered by the Force, some characters who undertake this specialization
                                        prefer to use their abilities to intimidate foes into surrender so they don’t have
                                        to kill needlessly. While they are extremely capable in this regard, they frequently
                                        learn the techniques required to cause the bare minimum of damage necessary. Precision
                                        is important, as every life still holds value in the Force.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">When confronted by a foe that seems irredeemable, however, the Aggressor’s
                                        attitude shifts appropriately. All elements of self-restraint are discarded, and
                                        the Aggressor is able to simply punish his foes, inflicting devastating blow after
                                        devastating blow. Often, opponents simply flee rather than engage an Aggressor. Stories
                                        told by survivors—and sometimes allies—add to the character’s reputation, making
                                        it even easier to intimidate future enemies.</p>

                                                Aggressor. Whether this character has actively sought vengeance for a singular
                                                event or a variety of causes, this reputation prevents some wrongs from happening
                                                in the first place. The thought of an Aggressor’s retribution strikes fear
                                                into the hearts of wrongdoers.

                                                the intention of coercing those in power to make changes. Whether dealing
                                                with a cheating merchant or a corrupt company, this Aggressor fights hard
                                                for change using whatever means necessary. A large following of like-minded
                                                characters helps, and the Aggressors reputation may assist them in amassing
                                                such a following; however, the lack of such support does not hold the Aggressor

                                                to inspire fear, and to use the resulting reputation to control difficult
                                                situations. An Aggressor may have learned such tactics while in service of

                                                dangerous. Alternatively, this Warrior may have simply found the military
