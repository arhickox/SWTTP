                                <p class="card-text">The Strategist is a relatively low-key Commander, but one who is crucial
                                        for the Rebellion to achieve victory over the Empire. Characters who have connections
                                        to Alliance High Command, or who have otherwise seen how planning and logistics function
                                        at a higher level, are prime candidates for such a change. Characters who might be
                                        considered “armchair generals” also fit the role well, as does anyone with an analytical
                                        mind.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">The role of a Strategist might also be tied to his prior specialization.
                                        For example, an excellent Slicer might be consulted as to the best way to lead a
                                        virtual assault on the Empire’s computer network.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Strategists are responsible for forming the core directives used in
                                        the war against the Empire. Rather than focusing on individual battles, they analyze
                                        the big picture—both what has happened and what is bound to happen should their plans
                                        bear fruit. They also monitor the effectiveness of logistics to ensure that military
                                        units aren’t too thinly spread or sparsely supplied to be effective. Anything that
                                        might change the tide of battle concerns them, and they must possess sharp minds
                                        and keen wits to keep all the variables under control.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Though they rarely possess direct command of armies or units, Strategists
                                        are expected to arrange the high- level details of the operations and battles the
                                        Rebel military must participate in. A Strategist must also be incredibly detail-oriented,
                                        as forgetting a minor item when planning a planetary strike could lead to the deaths
                                        of thousands of Alliance troops.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Strategists must be able to keep their cool. Viewing the Galactic Civil
                                        War from such a lofty vantage point can cause even the most tranquil individuals
                                        to break under pressure. In fact, the conflict at hand is so vast and complex that
                                        it can be difficult to digest it all, even in multiple sittings. Keeping a cool head
                                        also allows the Strategist an opportunity to examine an enemy’s movements in order
                                        to discern whether or not it is attempting a feint or a full-fledged assault. Imperial
                                        commanders are cunning tacticians, and their ruses can be disastrous if they aren’t
                                        seen for what they are before it’s too late.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Obviously, successful Strategists must know the ins and outs of warfare.
                                        Being aware of their enemies’ capabilities, as well as those of their own troops,
                                        is vital to planning a successful campaign. In addition, possessing intimate knowledge
                                        of wars both past and present allows Strategists to learn from the lessons of their
                                        predecessors, or to call up a little-used tactic to catch the Empire off guard.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Though a Strategist may seem like an odd choice for the typical Alliance
                                        cell, the knowledge and keen insight such a character brings to a party are well
                                        worth having. With a little combat training, a Strategist can act as a secondary
                                        combatant while watching the battlefield for signs of opportunity or disaster. Given
                                        their potential training in both Cool and Vigilance, it’s unlikely that a Strategist
                                        will be caught unawares when things turn ugly.</p>

                                                clear, for the Empire is a dark and secretive institution. Many of the most
                                                effective military Strategists in the Empire found themselves marginalized
                                                once the Gla- ctice Civil War was in full swing. Others decided that the
                                                war they were fighting wasn’t the right one and chose to take their abilities
                                                elsewhere. Whatever their reasons, they may very well have an inside view
                                                of the Empire’s motivations and future plans that could be of great value

                                                all that different from combat. Though the methods used to achieve victory
                                                may be different, the ultimate goal remains chillingly similar in all three
                                                mediums. Strategists from the civilian sector often have their roots in economic,
                                                corporate, or political endeavors. Those employed by the Rebel Alliance are
                                                likely to find themselves working to destroy the Empire not militarily, but
                                                economically. They also work to provide the Alliance with its own income
                                                streams, especially those that cannot be drastically affected by the Empire’s
                                                efforts to bankrupt the Rebellion.</li>

                                                of an entire conflict can be placed in jeopardy. This defeat can be the result
                                                of a single bad decision, or the product of a number of smaller mistakes
                                                that snowball into an overwhelming catastrophe. Though Strategists rarely
                                                work alone, especially in the higher echelons of Alliance Command, their
                                                expertise and opinions are well respected and always considered when plans
                                                are made. To fail at this level is a rebuke that few can bounce back from,
                                                but learning from one’s mistakes may very well make one a better Strategist
