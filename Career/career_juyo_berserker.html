                        <div class="card-body">
                                <p class="card-text">In the latter days of the Jedi Order, Padawans studied six forms of
                                        lightsaber combat, ensuring familiarity with all. Few Jedi, however, were trusted
                                        to study the seventh, the highly restricted Juyo form. The Juyo Berserker is a Warrior
                                        who fights with this dangerously aggressive and ferocious manner of lightsaber combat.
                                        A Juyo Berserker could have formal training in Form VII, but the specialization can
                                        also apply to a self-taught fighter who harnesses natural rage and ferocity to overcome
                                        foes with an all-out offensive.

                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">While Juyo is undoubtedly an aggressive form of combat by the standards
                                        of the Jedi, it nonetheless requires at least the modicum of control necessary to
                                        wield a lightsaber effectively and—relatively—safely. Compared to the other lightsaber
                                        forms in use by the Jedi in the latter days of the Republic, however, Juyo is reckless.
                                        Walking this fine line is not dissimilar from the way in which Juyo practitioners
                                        balance dangerously close to the dark side of the Force. </p>
                                <p class="card-text">While a Juyo practitioner may appear calm, the form requires intense
                                        emotions to fuel its rapid, unpredictable, powerful strikes. Some Juyo Berserkers—particularly
                                        adherents of the Jedi Code, which calls for tranquility and detachment—conceal the
                                        emotions raging below the surface. Others, including Sith, fully embrace the anger
                                        that drives Juyo and grants it power, snarling like frenzied animals as they lay
                                        into their opponents.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">For Force sensitives in the age of the Empire, it is all too easy to
                                        give in to frustration, anger, and hate when forced into a confrontation. They might
                                        unknowingly find themselves mimicking the Juyo style. These sentients might be aware
                                        of the conflict raging within them—the struggle between unbridled emotion and stability—or
                                        they might remain dangerously ignorant of the path to the dark side of the Force.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">A Juyo Berserker focuses on offense nearly to the exclusion of all else.
                                        This approach leaves the Berserker vulnerable should an opponent find the opportunity
                                        to counterattack, and so a Juyo practitioner must match the foe’s skill in pure ferocity.
                                        Juyo fighters particularly risk being overwhelmed by greater numbers; a Berserker
                                        must be able to lay about with the blistering relentlessness of many Warriors—or
                                        of the deadly predator from which the form draws its name.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Jedi who practiced Juyo were careful to balance inner darkness with
                                        the tranquility offered by the light side of the Force. It was in this way that Mace
                                        Windu developed the Vaapad variant, a form that allowed him to channel his inner
                                        darkness toward positive outcomes, to harness his anger without allowing it to control
                                        him. For Warriors bereft of the doctrines of the Jedi this balance is difficult.
                                        Without it, a tragic outcome could be all but inevitable.

                                                the avenger background, since the Juyo fighting style focuses the sort of
                                                aggression that vengeance often inspires. This character may have an unresolved
                                                personal vendetta that fuels the anger they channel as part of this art.
                                                The Juyo Berserker may have even turned to this style specifically in order
                                                to seek personal vengeance. Once this goal is accomplished, they are well
                                                equipped to perform similar services for others, and a Juyo Berserker might
                                                channel their anger for good.

                                                Berserker treats any task as a personal crusade. This character may have
                                                learned martial techniques with the intention of using them for change, channeling
                                                anger back toward whatever caused it in the first place. Taking on a particular
                                                cause helps this character to focus. However, a Juyo Berserker who commits
                                                too fully to a cause risks succumbing to that passion and the temptations
                                                of the dark side of the Force.

                                                not come naturally to the character. This requires a high level of control
