                                <p class="card-text">Pirates care about helping themselves, and they do not care how they
                                        do it. They’ll lead a crew to attack well-stocked spaceships. They’ll recruit a naive
                                        idealist to steal contraband so they can sell it at a profit. Some Pirates have even
                                        seen that there are greater potential rewards—such as ending the ever-increasing
                                        Imperial stranglehold over their independence—in working as somewhat-reliable rebels.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">For these cunning “entrepreneurs” unafraid to break a few rules, take
                                        some risks, and resort to violence, anyone else’s gains can become their own. The
                                        first law of piracy is that everything belongs to whomever can take it. However,
                                        this is an honorable profession; it’s just business, and never personal. At least,
                                        it isn’t until someone else makes it personal.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">While Pirates work for their own gain, the best opportunities require
                                        at least temporary support. Inside contacts, talented slicers, and reliable pilots
                                        can be invaluable—as are plenty of hired muscle to back up threats. Skilled Pirates
                                        are adept at manipulating those they work with (and anyone in their way) to achieve
                                        their goals, often via coercion and leveraging their dangerous reputations. Some
                                        might never need to fire a blaster, such is their terrifying renown, while others
                                        delight in violence that normal society does not allow.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Unrestricted by standard conventions of right and wrong, the methods
                                        that Pirates use can vary widely. Taking what they want is easy when no one else
                                        is left standing, so violence is frequently a first resort. If violence alone can’t
                                        work, or is impractical, they rely on cunning. Pirates might propose mutually beneficial
                                        agreements to secure assets essential to completing a job. Whether or not the deals
                                        are balanced or the Pirates even hold up their end is of little concern to them.
                                        This doesn’t mean that some Pirates won’t develop long-term arrangements, but often
                                        both parties are aware that such deals are strong only as long as both sides profit
                                        handsomely. Even so, most Pirates value their independence too much to be tied down
                                        for long, even to lucrative outsiders.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Regardless, Pirates sometimes find themselves aiding fledging anti-imperial
                                        cells. These desperate, outnumbered bands have few legal options for support. Many
                                        come to rely on the experience of Pirates for help—especially in learning how to
                                        survive outside the law and in finding unsavory but useful contacts. What might start
                                        as purely business dealings can grow to a more lasting association over exciting
                                        times, shared conflicts, and a few bottles of something jointly stolen. Whether a
                                        band of Pirates commits to a group of rebels for profit, shared aggression against
                                        the Empire, or pure boredom may never be known, but Pirates’ aid can keep such groups
                                        alive and fighting long after others have fallen.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Pirates can be duplicitous, conniving, violent con-artists, but they
                                        are almost always effective. Whether they are finding criminally-profitable jobs
                                        or manipulating their own comrades to make them more effective against the Empire,
                                        Pirates are constantly twisting situations to gain the most benefit. They almost
                                        always focus the benefit for themselves first, but sometimes it can spill over to
                                        their allies.
