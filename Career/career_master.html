                                <p class="card-text">A Jedi cannot ignore the binding principle that connects
                                        the galaxy, especially at a time of war. While a civilian
                                        may not see any utility in silent contemplation of the
                                        Force, a Master understands that wisdom can come
                                        from anywhere and everywhere. Although the title of
                                        “Master” requires the approval of the Jedi Council, this
                                        specialization covers overall wisdom, self-reflection, and
                                        mastery of the Force. A true Jedi Master requires no formal title. The Force recognizes their ability.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">A master's skills reflect a Master’s inner control and
                                        search for knowledge and self-understanding. They also
                                        represent a Master’s responsibility to teach both Jedi
                                        and non-Jedi how to understand themselves and act in accordance with that knowledge. Masters meditate,
                                        instruct formally in classrooms or informally in conversation, and seek out ancient texts.                                        
                                        </p>
                                <p class="card-text">In times of war, Jedi Masters serve an even greater
                                        purpose in bringing inner peace and hope to others.
                                        Jedi who have seen the horrors of war, who doubt their
                                        purpose and themselves, can go to a Master for guidance, to re-center themselves and regain perspective.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">By sensing disturbances in the Force, Masters can
                                        locate areas of conflict and anguish and advise Jedi on
                                        the field of an otherwise unknown trouble. They
                                        can also sense agents of the dark side of the
                                        Force and seek them out, countering their
                                        effects on the galaxy. They continue to seek
                                        out lost knowledge, not only of the Jedi’s history but of the galaxy’s. One can never
                                        discount how an obscure item of knowledge can provide a greater wisdom, as all
                                        things are connected by the Force.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Lest other Jedi fall into the
                                        trap of treating the Force as
                                        a tool—or worse, a weapon
                                        of war—Masters must
                                        remind them of the central promise of the Force:
                                        its ability to connect
                                        and understand all life.
                                        The pursuit of this
                                        understanding, the
                                        peaceful exploration
                                        of the galaxy, and
                                        the steady journey
                                        toward self-realization
                                        are central to the Jedi
                                        Order’s core principles.
                                        Masters remind the warriors
                                        in the Jedi ranks that they
                                        fight in spite of their quest for
                                        peace, not because of it.
                                        </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Masters guide other Jedi,
                                        especially if they suffer from
                                        anger or self-doubt. Masters
                                        have wisdom that lets them
                                        see the bigger picture, one
                                        greater than the Clone
                                        Wars or the Republic. Danger lies in forgetting about I
                                        the smaller picture. The
                                        galaxy is made up of individuals, single points of
                                        light in the darkness, and
                                        to assume one individual

                                        the greatest hubris.</p>
