                                <p class="card-text">Depending on who is asked, Mechanics are either the glue that holds
                                        everything together or the grease that makes it all go. Most Mechanics would tell
                                        you they do both, and then get back to work.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Pragmatic and tough are two key traits that come out of a Mechanic's
                                        talent tree, as are the many ways he is capable of fixing what's broken and being
                                        prepared for any mechanical contingencies that arise.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">While it is relatively easy to find a Mechanic almost anywhere in the
                                        galaxy, it's considerably more difficult to find a good one, and even harder to find
                                        one that can be trusted. Ship captains will literally travel across systems to get
                                        to a Mechanic they can trust to do a good job for them, which is why Mechanics tend
                                        to be in high demand.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">A Mechanic that's hooked up with the typical Player Character group
                                        has likely decided he doesn't want to spend all of his time in a work pit or engineering
                                        hangar. He probably wants to see a bit of the galaxy and get some flight time in.
                                        Fortunately, Mechanics tend to pick up a few things about how to take care of themselves
                                        in tough situations, and given a few minutes and some random devices, they may well
                                        cobble together a rather explosive means of dealing with real problems.</p>

                                                individuals who grow up in truly low-tech communities are just as innovative

                                                chemistry, and machines that do not rely on electricity. Such an individual
                                                might be a specialist at producing a particular thing, like a blacksmith,
                                                architect, or weaver, but might also be a generalist who serves a community’s
                                                wider needs. Unleashed upon the galaxy, such an Antiquarian would likely

                                                interests by creating increasingly refined designs. Growing up around starships
                                                would have given the character an unmatched fluency in this craft. With this

                                                frequently can’t purchase every device their crews need. It often falls
                                                to ships’ Mechanics to build something from scratch to solve problems that
                                                nobody foresaw. However, while some Mechanics are content to simply cobble
                                                together an inefficient solution, Tech Designers believe that if they’re

                                                board might be impractical in the midst of a crisis, doing so when the Mechanic
                                                has time to carefully design and construct a device that not only solves
                                                the problem in the short term, but also minimizes waste and unforeseen consequences
                                                in the future.

                                                of roles in the criminal underworld, and one of the most notorious jobs
                                                is as a laborer in a starship chop shop. These illegal operations, often
                                                disguised as legitimate garages, dismantle stolen starships so that their
                                                parts can be sold without an obvious trail. A Mechanic who got started in
                                                such an environment would likely be very skilled at assessing and dismantling
                                                vehicles, but might well dream of putting them together instead. The chance
                                                to do so might be enough to lure such a character away from steady (if ethically
