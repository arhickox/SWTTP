                                <p class="card-text">Seekers are often at the forefront of exploration, pushing back the
                                        edges of the unknown across planets and systems throughout the galaxy. Most view
                                        the mission itself as more important than the plotting needed to undertake it, and
                                        determining its best method and route unimportant when compared to what awaits at
                                        the destination. Others, though, see these as perhaps at least as important, and
                                        certainly more personally rewarding. Navigators represent those Seekers who devote
                                        themselves fully to these aspects, from charting hyperspace passages or plotting
                                        overland routes. No matter the environment, none can match Navigators when they set
                                        about deciding a course. When Navigators use the Force, their abilities might even
                                        appear more reliant on fantastic luck than skill to the uninitiated.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Navigators are often excellent pilots as well, but these Seekers are
                                        generally more interested in the best way for their vehicle to arrive safely and
                                        expeditiously than in its firepower or maneuverability. Some of these individuals
                                        may have spent their entire lives in space, moving from ship to ship or working one
                                        specific area filled with hazardous asteroids or nests of black holes. Most jr travel
                                        extensively, regardless of their origins, always seeking out new, uncharted regions
                                        in need of their abilities. The addition of Astrogation allows Navigators to truly
                                        excel in outer space, where they can help ensure the group arrives speedily and accurately
                                        to distant star systems.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Navigators are also excellent on planets, charting routes over sea,
                                        land, and air, as well as even orbital voyages. Their skills are especially critical
                                        on uncharted worlds, but they are also valuable in urban settings, which can be as
                                        unfathomable as any dense jungle or endless steppe. When the PCs need to find the
                                        fastest, safest, or least conspicuous way to reach their destination, Navigators
                                        are whom they turn to. Invaluable in chases, whether the PCs are trying to run down
                                        their quarry or escape pursuit, Navigators can give a group the edge it needs by
                                        locating the most efficient route.</p>

                                                enough that few would be interested in driving them away. However, that same
                                                knowledge might actually be the source of their exile. Their knack for finding
                                                new routes and hidden places could have lead to their being considered a
                                                security threat by anyone from skulking criminals to customs officials. They
                                                might have even actually stumbled upon a secret hyperlane or installation
                                                that drew Imperial attention. Fortunately for Navigators, their special talents
                                                are just the thing to keep them one step ahead of their pursuers.</li>

                                                new goals. Simply getting from one place to the next, whether driving a caravan
                                                of hurghols through a mountain pass or guiding a scout ship down a dangerous
                                                hyperlane, can be a destination as well as a journey. Some Navigators might
                                                want to visit as many different planets as possible, or to see what life
                                                is like across all the sectors of the known galaxy.</li>

                                                regions or worlds and more populous ones. With their knack for mastering
                                                difficult planetary routes or hyperlane passages, Navigators have the potential
                                                to transform lives for the better, delivering needed supplies or assisting
                                                in conversation between beings who might otherwise never trade or communicate.
                                                Not all Navigators take to this role with the neutrality or altruism that
                                                might be hoped for, however. Some use their knowledge of exclusive routes
                                                to smuggle illicit goods or even extort high fees from those seeking to use

                                                that the trouble is of their own making. With their talent for discovering
                                                the best route between any two points, sometimes they find themselves rushing
                                                headlong into previously unknown dangers. Whether they have a habit of straining
                                                their hyperdrives with untested jumps, or pushing just a little too far into
                                                a hostile wilderness before turning back, these Navigators must become self-reliant
                                                in order to find the way back to safety from all manner of circumstance.
                                                Those who cannot learn to help themselves in extremity rarely last long enough
                                                to make a habit of getting into such scrapes.</li>

                                                lives on the move. In fact, for many of them, it may be that staying in one
                                                place for long is the issue. Between their natural affinity for travel and

                                                down, even for a little while. Some see this as a problem, or at least an
