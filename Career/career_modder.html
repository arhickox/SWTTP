                                <p class="card-text">If someone keeps disassembling and reassembling the rest of the crew's
                                        weapons, armor, and gear without permission, it's a safe bet that the culprit is
                                        the team's Technician. If those items actually work better afterward, that Technician
                                        might well be a Modder. Modders are chronic tinkerers, and most Modders would rather
                                        add features to machines they already have than build new ones. By turning their
                                        engineering prowess toward relentlessly repairing, optimizing, testing, calibraLing,
                                        and re-repairing mechanisms around them, Modders make any piece of technology their
                                        own-even if it isn't, strictly speaking, theirs.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">A Modder can be extremely versatile: in some ways, a Modder specializes
                                        in generalizing. By spending less time and energy learning how to build devices from
                                        the ground up, a Modder can focus on how to optimize and customize all sorts of devices-from
                                        weapons to ships, droids to personal gear. Of course, one project might hold a Modder's
                                        interest more than others, at least for a while. The Modder's talents allow a character
                                        to focus heavily on a single project or flit from one exciting upgrade to another
                                        at a moment's notice. Whether it's a starship engine or a shiny new blaster, a Modder
                                        can probably find a way to make it better.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Many teams of renegades and rogues benefit from having a Modder around,
                                        as this character can offer a number of unique upgrades to starships and vehicles,
                                        as well as better access to attachments for weapons. Modders can certainly be competent
                                        pilots and combatants in their own right. Modders who seek out battle in person benefit
                                        from a high Agility. With or without an investment in this characteristic, though,
                                        combat-oriented Modders are most effective when backed up by teams of specialists
                                        carrying the souped-up firepower and piloting the uniquely customi1ed ships that
                                        only Modders can provide.</p>

                                                ventures from history and the forgotten edges of galactic society. Some Modders
                                                dive headlong into this world of rediscovery, seeking out ancient or overlooked
                                                cultures and integrating their unique innovations into existing pieces of

                                                have a place on any development team, be it with a major corporation or at
                                                a small technology firm. After all, while the original designer comes up
                                                with a device’s intended purpose, someone has to figure out what the machine
                                                is actually good for. For this task of product testing, few can match a Modder’s

                                                can get the most out of a starship’s engine to help it escape Imperial patrols,
