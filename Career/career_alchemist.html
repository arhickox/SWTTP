                                <p class="card-text">During the era of the Galactic Republic, the Jedi Order never embraced
                                        alchemy. Various spiritual orders that had worked in alchemy also allied with the
                                        dark side of the Force. The Sith, the Nightsisters of Dathomir, and the Frangawl
                                        Cult on Bardotta all used the dark side to power their weapons, talismans, and magicks.
                                        Whether or not the Jedi thought that alchemy led to the dark side of the Force has
                                        been lost to time. Perhaps the Order felt that giving life to the inanimate, pouring
                                        the Force into a dead object, replicated the act of giving life, of giving birth,
                                        or of playing god, and would cause the Jedi to become prideful.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">With the rise of the Empire and the loss of the Jedi Order, now no one
                                        can warn a potential Alchemist away from practicing this lost art. This might be
                                        just as well. Just like any technology, it isn’t the object but the user that makes
                                        it good or bad, light or dark, useful or destructive. In addition, the Force flows
                                        through everything, even inanimate objects. Rocks have a measure of the Force in
                                        them. How else could a Jedi move them? With that reasoning, nothing should prevent
                                        a Jedi from imbuing a machine with the Force, save the Jedi’s own fears, hatred,
                                        and obsessions.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Jedi built their own lightsabers not only for ritual or training
                                        purposes, but to infuse a bit of their own essence into the weapon. The Jedi consciously
                                        and deliberately built these weapons both as a technical test and as a meditative
                                        test. It could be argued that a lightsaber contains the presence of its creator—and
                                        perhaps its user(s).
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Force alchemy extends this idea and discipline further, crafting physical
                                        objects infused with the power of the Force. These objects appear to have a life
                                        of their own, and in the eyes of a Force sensitive, perhaps they do. This creates
                                        a metaphysical conundrum: if an object possesses a measure of the Force, how is it
                                        different from a living being?
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Alchemists tend to focus on medicinal concoctions, since the healing
                                        of a physical body is the most direct method of using and influencing the Force.
                                        The flow of a medicine, tincture, salve, or draught mimics the flow of the Force.
                                        Alchemists can work in other materials, but this requires more training and attention.
                                        A malformed or malfunctioning machine can’t be fixed with an infusion of the Force.
                                        In many ways, it might exacerbate the damage.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Folk tales and popular holovids of machines coming to life and terrorizing
                                        their creators and innocents may be based on true stories of Alchemists who fell
                                        to the dark side of the Force. Force-infused objects can be tortured as much as any
                                        living creature. When the Alchemist is a dark side user, alchemical machines take
                                        on a sinister and dangerous aura, “malfunctioning” to cause harm or, in the case
                                        of a weapon, increasing suffering when it does cause harm.

                                                designers, and body modifiers, working in the physical. They found themselves
                                                drawn to making a thing with a purpose, a reason given form. Admirers would
                                                tell these artists that their works had a mind of their own, a life and personality.
                                                This praise, however, never felt true. They weren’t the ones who gave it
                                                life; something else, something unexplainable, did. Without realizing it,
                                                these artists had designed with the principle that Force follows form follows
                                                function, until one day they had discovered all three meant the same thing.

                                                of roles. Some experimented with chemicals to produce visions, either through
                                                street drugs or corporate-sponsored research into mind-enhancing medicines.
                                                Other alchemical augurs produced vaccines to inoculate a population from
                                                an impending outbreak or produced analgesics to ease pain. All of them shared
                                                the ability of diagnosis, isolating the source of an ailment and perceiving
                                                a cure. Of all of the augur backgrounds, Alchemists have the most practical
                                                of mind sets; looking forward to results, they take a little longer to accept

                                                abilities for good at first. As con artists, they created fakes: harmless
                                                chemicals instead of dangerous drugs, a “priceless” painting for the rich,
                                                or even weapons that didn’t function (for the truly brave or foolish). When
                                                the fakes somehow helped improve lives, such as that dose of fake spice curing

                                                to donate to charity, these con artists chalked it up to happy accidents.
                                                Soon, they found themselves glad of these mistakes and gave up the criminal
                                                life to do good.

                                                concoctions and inventions to fix that machine. Medicine can treat the symptoms
