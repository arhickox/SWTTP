                                        and come to violence. In the time of the Republic, many Jedi peacemakers trained
                                        with the lightsaber to prepare themselves for that eventuality. Today, Consulars
                                        who wish to do the same can focus on self-defense and gain a working knowledge of
                                        lightsaber combat by following the path of the Niman Disciple.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Niman Disciples remain focused on working with groups of individuals
                                        to come to a peaceful accord, but they acknowledge that the road to that accord may
                                        be fraught with danger. These skills can make surviving in a treacherous environment
                                        much more possible.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Due to Consulars’ naturally compassionate nature, this path centers
                                        on developing defensive measures in concert with negotiation techniques. In general,
                                        the associated combat techniques are focused on survival and defense instead of attack.
                                        Also, due to the Consular’s emphasis on mental discipline and self control, the Niman
                                        Disciple puts more emphasis on integrating his Force abilities into his fighting
                                        style, using the Force as his ally to defeat dangerous foes.</p>

                                                received formal lightsaber instruction, making the Niman Disciple a rarity
                                                when it comes to this background. Instead, most of them find themselves intuitively
                                                practicing the techniques of the Niman, as if the Force itself were guiding
                                                them, leading them along this path. They have little desire to inflict violence
                                                upon others, but in the wake of the Jedi Order’s destruction, they recognize
                                                that there are many cherished things, people, and even ideals that are worth
                                                defending.

                                                with the destruction of the Jedi Order. Niman Disciples study what few fragmentary
                                                texts remain or searches for hidden practitioners who might have been masters
                                                of the iconic Jedi weapon. The practice of wielding a lightsaber is a study
                                                unto itself. Niman Disciples echo duelists of the past, rediscover lost techniques,
                                                and carry on the legacy of this forbidden weapon so they might find a brighter
                                                tomorrow. Because the Niman style focuses heavily on inner peace and serenity,
                                                these rogue scholars seek to become a simple stillness in a galaxy torn apart
                                                by conflict. Each secret they discover can be felt in the gentle hum of this
                                                ancient weapon.

                                                galaxy for relics focus their investigation on lost lightsaber technology.
                                                This goes beyond the obvious search for crystals and construction methods;
                                                many Niman Disciples seek out instructional texts and holocrons, as well
                                                as any remaining records that discuss the philosophy behind the art of the
                                                lightsaber. For all Jedi, and especially Niman Disciples, wielding the weapon
                                                of the lost order is as much a spiritual exercise as a physical one—if not
                                                more so.

                                                on the lightsaber, Niman Disciples make excellent negotiators and diplomats.
                                                They recognize that a weapon should only be drawn if the wielder is willing
                                                to use it. As such, when they do ignite their lightsabers, it is done as
                                                an act of protection—to defuse violence before there is no turning back.
                                                By staving off greater violence with lesser methods, they can sue for peace
                                                when the dust settles and cooler heads can prevail.
