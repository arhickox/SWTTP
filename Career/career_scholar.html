                                <p class="card-text">At first, the idea of a Scholar wandering with a bunch of ne'er-do-wells
                                        in the Outer Rim might seem a bit odd, if not downright ridiculous. However, with
                                        all of the dangers and wonders of "a thousand thousand worlds," having someone around
                                        who actually knows something more than how to reload a heavy blaster could be exceedingly
                                        useful under any number of circumstances. This is especially true when a group is
                                        faced with something truly unknown, or needs to find something that simple tracking
                                        alone cannot locate. The Scholar's skills emphasize both his role as a font of information
                                        and his keen awareness of his surroundings.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Even in the Outer Rim, there are those who have a keen respect for knowledge
                                        and learning. Even criminal overlords find having some "brains" around helps them
                                        when they want to expand their operations or exploit a new opportunity. Other Scholars,
                                        however, are far more interested in getting out into the galaxy, seeing for themselves
                                        the things they wish to study, and digging around in ancient places for the lost
                                        knowledge they want to uncover.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">A Scholar in a group is very likely of the held researcher variety;
                                        seeking allies with physical capabilities who can defend him is a matter of simple
                                        expediency. It may be that he's signed on with some kind of operation that actually
                                        has no direct impact on his research, but the group is likely to travel to places
                                        he wishes to go, which suits his desires well.</p>

                                                reception may depend entirely on their demeanor. A polite or deferential

                                                a proper education and career in academia was always out of reach. Thus he
                                                became a self-taught researcher or historian, but without the credentials

                                                harm, and he doubted his employer could resist the temptation of using it.
                                                His only recourse was to flee, vanishing from galactic society as best he
                                                could. In this case, the corporation doesn't just want the Scholar, they
