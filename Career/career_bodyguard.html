                                <p class="card-text">Hired Guns who choose the Bodyguard specialization are excellent choices
                                        for defending both people and places. They tend to be highly capable with all kinds
                                        of weaponry, extremely tough and savvy in combat, and exactly the right people to
                                        get behind when blaster fire starts flying.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">With their array of skills, a Bodyguard can operate anything that shoots,
                                        keep a good eye on his surroundings, and can handle any planet-bound craft with great
                                        aptitude. This, combined with his talent options, makes him potentially perfect as
                                        an armed chauffeur or as a heavy weapons emplacement operator. He also makes a resilient
                                        soldier.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">A Bodyguard will have a rather easy time finding work in the Outer Rim,
                                        especially if he doesn't mind looking after the backside of high-ranking criminal
                                        scum or corporate operators who are trying to do business without becoming victims.
                                        His facility with all kinds of weapons and vehicles make him useful to any number
                                        of quasi-legal or criminal operations.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">As part of a group of Player Characters, a Bodyguard is going to be
                                        considered more or less a heavy combatantâ€”the guy who stands up front with the biggest
                                        gun. However, the combination of skills and talents can be angled towards some different
                                        approaches. For example, if there's any kind of Politico or Trader in the group,
                                        a Bodyguard may well be there solely for the purpose of keeping that person alive.</p>

                                                to be unobtrusive. Blending into the background is a useful job skill, and
                                                generally everyone's attention is focused on the person the Bodyguard is
                                                guarding. However, a Bodyguard could benefit from the fame and fortune of
                                                his client. If protecting a holovid star or other galactic celebrity, the
                                                Bodyguard might tangentially benefit from the lifestyle of the rich and famous.
                                                When that job ended or if the client suddenly fell from fame, the Bodyguard
                                                might have a hard time adjusting to life without the comforts provided to
                                                the rich and famous.</li>

                                                to have received formal trainng in protecting a client, and more likely to
                                                be adapting his combat training to his new job. A former soldier turned Bodyguard
                                                is likely to beieve that the best defense is overwhelming firepower, which
                                                can lead to some awkward situations in a civilized setting. However, a Bodyguard
                                                can bring the discipline, loyalty, and dedication of his military career
                                                into his new job, all of which are traits that make him suited to protect

                                                after a client was killed or kidnapped under their watch. Not only would
                                                this leave a Bodyguard with the shame of failure, but he might have been
                                                injured or even left for dead during the operation. Now, he must discover

                                                offering up the ultimate sacrifice in the course of his duty. Dying while
                                                protecting a client could make one a hero and martyr both, but it creates
                                                a legacy that's impossible to live up to. The character might be making his

                                                started his life as a teacher or mentor. As teachers are often put in charge
                                                of the wellbeing and instruction of individuals, they frequently become caring
