                                        patriots, depending on which side of
                                        their blasters one faces. Historical revisionists and a terrorist group to the
                                        Republic,
                                        the Death Watch believes that the Mandalorians should return to their warrior
                                        roots. In order to reclaim their so-called heritage, they allied with the
                                        Separatists, performing commando raids and sabotage
                                        against the Republic in
                                        exchange for political
                                        support against the
                                        recognized Mandalorian government.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Mandalore’s location at
                                        the border of the Outer
                                        Rim and the inner rims of
                                        the galaxy makes Mandalorian Space highly coveted and
                                        contested. Historians have debated
                                        whether this constant invasion into the
                                        Mandalorians’ space led to their ancient warrior culture, or if their prime
                                        location led them
                                        toward dreams of conquest. Regardless, Mandalore
                                        has chosen a peaceful path. The Death Watch, however,
                                        sees this as a betrayal of both their past and their future.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Mandalorian Civil War saw the progenitors of the
                                        Death Watch exiled to the moon Concordia. The survivors re-formed as the Death
                                        Watch, which wants a
                                        strong and independent Mandalore ruled by warriors,
                                        free from the machinations of the Galactic Republic
                                        but also unshackled from the Separatists’ idealistic
                                        rebellion. First, they must overthrow the current Mandalorian government, whose
                                        Republic membership
                                        keeps them tied to galactic politics and whose
                                        pacifism is an affront to Death Watch militarism. The Death Watch intends to
                                        transform
                                        Mandalore into a militant culture once
                                        more and reclaim its lost territory.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">A Death Watch Warrior utilizes hit-and-run tactics and rapid, surgical
                                        strikes. Without a true army, the Death
                                        Watch cannot hold territory, but
                                        it can disrupt, destroy, and raze strategic locations such as communication outposts, power
                                        plants, and defense systems.
                                        To assist in their lightning
                                        attacks, each warrior trains
                                        in the use of a jetpack.
                                        This helps them to gain
                                        higher ground, find
                                        cover, and access
                                        targets. With time
                                        and planning, a warrior can engage in acts of sabotage.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">A Death Watch Warrior also needs
                                        to express their aggression at the
                                        negotiation table. Compromise breeds
                                        weakness. Extortion, strong-arming,
                                        even a little blackmail showcases power
                                        and command. The Death Watch doesn’t
                                        need compromise; it needs victories.
                                        </p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Death Watch has no disdain for
                                        the Mandalorian people, just for their
                                        misguided belief in peace. It merely
                                        needs to show them the glory of battle
                                        and the rewards of taking their birthright. To cleanse the peaceful rot in their
                                        society, Death Watch aims to eliminate
                                        leaders who cannot change and the
                                        Republic that backs them. If the Separatists refuse to give aid—or worse, dictate
                                        Mandalore’s destiny—then the Death
                                        Watch intends to fight the whole galaxy
                                        to the end.</p>
