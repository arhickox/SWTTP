                                <p class="card-text">When working alone in a hostile environment, every physical conflict
                                        must be resolved quickly and decisively. Frequently, an uncivilized planet completely
                                        lacks any sort of medical facilities. In fact, at times, an isolated explorer could
                                        be the only sentient being on the world. In such a situation, a minor injury can
                                        be deadly. If a conflict is necessary, it is better to resolve it quickly, taking
                                        whatever risks are involved, than to fight more conservatively and prolong the risk
                                        of injury. The Ataru Striker embraces this approach, throwing himself into combat
                                        with every fiber of his being.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Their fighting style is highly dependent on the combatant’s ability
                                        to quickly assess a situation and use natural athleticism to exploit the environment.
                                        In this way, the combatant is able to gain every possible advantage over an opponent.
                                        The combination of these edges and the rapid attacks that characterize Ataru martial
                                        arts can force a combat to a very quick resolution.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Practitioners of the Ataru fighting style must be supremely confident
                                        in their abilities. They must also be exceptionally athletic and capable of committing
                                        all their energy into a very brief conflict. When engaged in a physical conflict,
                                        Ataru Strikers fight without remorse but also with little concern for their own safety.
                                        Every motion is designed to inflict a flurry of rapid and overpowering attacks against
                                        their opponents from myriad angles. Their vicious and unrelenting offense is their
                                        best (and sometimes only) defense—most opponents are so busy defending themselves
                                        that they have no time to attack in turn.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">However, this style of unrelenting attack can have its disadvantages.
                                        An Ataru Striker needs to see his opponent defeated quickly, before he exhausts himself.
                                        An individual who can outlast an Ataru Striker can prove to be his deadliest enemy.</p>

                                                or conflict made them unwelcome or even feared by those around them. Although
                                                Ataru Strikers understand that decisive action is often necessary, those

                                                use came to light in the conflict. Alternatively, they may have had to flee
                                                from Imperial forces after showing too much open interest in Jedi techniques

                                                might spend their lives traveling from place to place, resolving strife by

                                                life. Ataru Strikers have internalized the dangers that surround them, readying

                                                and struggle, but some fight tougher battles than most. Whether too headstrong
                                                to stop and pick their fights, or too determined to give up against tough
                                                odds, these warriors are used to being underdogs—and used to finding a way
                                                to win anyway. Even so, they rarely last long in the galaxy without learning

                                                Seekers who travel the galaxy often develop the skills of Ataru Strikers,
