                                <p class="card-text">There is more to military intelligence than stealing the enemy’s secrets.
                                        That data must be secured and delivered to the specialists who can best exploit it.
                                        The Courier specializes in transporting critical information, often while working
                                        incognito far behind enemy lines. These experts take the necessary risks of repeatedly
                                        crossing through security checkpoints or even active battlefronts. They must be capable
                                        of operating under foes’ scrutiny without drawing undue attention. To a certain extent,
                                        these Spies are a very specialized type of smuggler, dealing primarily in information
                                        rather than physical goods. Not surprisingly, many Couriers developed underworld
                                        contacts working as smugglers prior to joining the Rebellion.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">In order to avoid Imperial entanglements, Couriers must be capable of
                                        operating without drawing attention to themselves. As they cannot expect to always
                                        succeed, these characters must also recognize the signs of trouble and have the ability
                                        to act quickly to escape entrapment. Because they often face overwhelming odds, personal
                                        speed is typically a higher priority than a trusted weapon.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Some Couriers prefer to work consistent routes as they shuttle information
                                        away from prying Imperial eyes. These specialists need a reliable cover story that
                                        they can use repeatedly. They might pose as merchants or transport drivers plying
                                        consistent trade routes. In a few instances, a Rebel might even take on the cover
                                        profession as a means of obtaining additional income, carrying innocuous cargo to
                                        market while smuggling critical information. Such Spies go to great lengths to ensure
                                        that their business interests are completely legitimate, so that they do not attract
                                        any undue attention. They also make sure that those interests are at least marginally
                                        profitable. A merchant who loses money consistently for years, after all, is just
                                        as likely to draw government attention as one who manages exorbitant profits. These
                                        individuals may even establish friendly relationships with the guards along their
                                        routes, and their frequent passage through Imperial territory becomes just a part
                                        of a station’s routine traffic. In these cases, typically only a subset of their
                                        transits include military intelligence.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Other Couriers deliver critical data to Rebel specialists in a variety
                                        of locations instead of adopting a mundane occupation that involves travel on regular
                                        routes. Some are enthusiastic adrenaline junkies who call on wild speed and quick
                                        thinking to overcome Imperial security. More risk-averse Couriers simply excel at
                                        developing good cover stories and staying true to their roles during a mission. Adrenaline
                                        junkies or not, these Couriers are unlikely to have any established relationship
                                        with the local Imperial guards. Consequently, they must quickly determine how to
                                        bypass security or rely on other intelligence sources to prepare for it.
