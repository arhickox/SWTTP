                                        prizes for doing so. "Slicing" is the term used for the invasive efforts to steal
                                        or alter data in a system. With practically the entire galaxy wired to computerized
                                        systems, Slicers are extremely valuable people to know, and dangerous to cross. Their
                                        talents mainly focus on making computerized and electronic systems dance to their
                                        tune.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Slicers are among the most valued professionals in the Outer Rim, especially
                                        to the criminal world. A Slicer's worth, however, is only as good as his reputation;
                                        success and loyalty will earn him top credits, while blowing key operations or double-crossing
                                        an employer will tend to make his prospects far less attractive.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">A Player Character group without a Slicer will have something of a handicap,
                                        especially where acquiring data or handling computerized problems is concerned. A
                                        Slicer might join a group for a chance to get away from a bad deal, or simply because
                                        he's ready to see the next planet. Slicers tend to be a quirky bunch, so there might
                                        be any number of motivations at work.</p>

                                                even longer than they have had starships or droids. While many Slicers look
                                                down on ancient computer interfaces, the wise know that the past is the
                                                foundation of the future. A Slicer who understands computer code from a historical
                                                perspective can often find vulnerabilities and back doors buried deep in
                                                layers of digital sediment and use these to gain an advantage over the competition.

                                                computers. A Born Engineer can thrive in such an environment, and might have
                                                quickly taken to creating and modifying code, becoming a Slicer. Because

                                                even more infuriating thorn in their side. Such a Slicer might have been
                                                a sort of law enforcer, helping maintain order on the station, or might have
                                                become a local renegade, using a mastery of computers to steal credits, evade
                                                the authorities, or pursue some other goal frowned upon by those in power.

                                                current are always learning new tricks, developing new workarounds to common
                                                security, and finding ways to subvert security. However, some of the most
                                                dangerous Slicers are those who design their own rigs and programs, and they
                                                can be very difficult for even the most skilled administrators to predict

                                                alike through clever use of computers. However, some of the best Slicers
                                                who act as Underworld Tech Experts are strictly freelance. These individuals
                                                can crack any computer, foil any droid’s programming, and stalk through the
                                                HoloNet like a ghost, acquiring information without anyone else ever knowing.
                                                These masterful Slicers are more than mere infochants, for not only can they
                                                intercept information, but they can also change it, distribute it, and fabricate
                                                it wholesale. The best of the best sometimes consider themselves artists
                                                as much as Technicians and demand exorbitant fees for their efforts, taking
                                                on only the jobs that catch their interest. Such Slicers are vanishingly
                                                rare, but their impact can be felt across the galaxy—if they want anyone
                                                to know that they exist at all, that is.
