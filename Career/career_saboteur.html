                                <p class="card-text">Almost anathema to the usual technician's mentality, the Saboteur specializes
                                        in disrupting and destroying technical and mechanical assets. His job is to diminish
                                        the enemy's capacity to wage war by denying the enemy use of its weapons and vehicles.
                                        Of course, it takes a high degree of understanding about how something works in order
                                        to ensure it ceases working, or better still, to ensure it never works again.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Saboteurs are, by nature, covert operation specialists with a strong
                                        need to be able to sneak in and out of enemy facilities. In addition, they understand
                                        that disrupting the computer networks that run such facilities is a key to success.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Blowing things up is a popular way to commit sabotage, and Saboteurs
                                        are often the best at handling demolitions tasks (often using a combination of Mechanics
                                        and Skulduggery). However, there are many other ways to disrupt and destroy machinery,
                                        and the Saboteur knows them all. Most often, he will seek a way to cause the most
                                        damage and the most chaos at just the right moment. For the Saboteur (especially
                                        one with a sense of style), timing is everything.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Alliance makes quiet yet effective use of its Saboteurs. Though
                                        terrorism is not a part of the battle plan (and is expressly forbidden by Mon Mothma
                                        and the rest of the Alliance Council), acts of military sabotage are known to be
                                        highly effective in evening the odds before a battle. Most commanders in the Rebellion
                                        will simply indicate a target and a time frame, allowing the Saboteur to use his
                                        creativity and resourcefulness to achieve the objective.</p>

                                                cousins, are typically military instructors. With their in-depth knowledge
                                                of explosives, engineering, and covert operations, academic Saboteurs teach
                                                the fine art of eradicating enemy materiel and infrastructure. In addition
                                                to offering more traditional classroom instruction, they often instruct insurgents
                                                and irregular troops in guerrilla tactics. Academic Saboteurs are rare in
                                                the Alliance, and indeed they are relatively uncommon throughout the galaxy.
                                                Skilled Saboteurs who can pass on their knowledge to Rebel troops are highly
                                                sought after.

                                                These are the reckless bombers, the devil-may-care explosives experts who
                                                keep a block of detonite as a doorstop and make fireworks that put some military
                                                ordnance to shame. Their in-depth knowledge of explosive devices and compounds
                                                is often warped by their inability to take anything seriously and their love
                                                of huge explosions no matter the risk or cost. Eccentric Saboteurs make excellent
                                                Rebel operatives, even though they make their colleagues extremely nervous.
