                                <p class="card-text">Resolving the conflicts of thousands of civiIlizations across the
                                        galaxy is a colossal
                                        undertaking, yet the Galactic Senate takes
                                        that as its function. The Senators who
                                        debate and negotiate within the Senate rotunda represent entire planets or
                                        corporate organizations; each Senator is
                                        a single voice speaking for millions. Yet,
                                        in representing such a massive constituency, it is almost impossible for one
                                        person to balance the needs of the
                                        myriad smallergroups within the
                                        whole. For this reason, many
                                        worlds have one or more
                                        Republic Senate representatives, sometimes known
                                        as junior representatives,
                                        nonvoting members of
                                        Senate who represent a minority political
                                        party or species. Representatives work
                                        closely with Senators as a delegation,
                                        to better represent
                                        the interests of a planet’s entire population.
                                        Republic Representatives
                                        are expert politicians in
                                        their own right, working
                                        with each other and their
                                        world’s Senator to determine what problems—or
                                        solutions—they should
                                        collectively bring before
                                        the Galactic Senate.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The retinue of a Senator is, in many ways,
                                        like a miniature Senate of its own. Because
                                        no Senator can be
                                        familiar with all of the
                                        diverse cultures they
                                        represent, the many
                                        junior representatives
                                        who work with them
                                        stand in as the voices of
                                        their constituents. Each
                                        representative is sent
                                        to represent a distinct population or political coalition. A representative
                                        must be a master of diplomacy to ensure that their
                                        constituency’s issues are taken seriously by the rest of
                                        their delegation, and they must be adaptable enough
                                        to retain the favor of their Senator and their political allies. Although a representative does not hold the
                                        power to vote or introduce legislation—except when
                                        fulfilling a Senator’s duties during that Senator’s leave
                                        of absence—they can sit on committees, and they
                                        receive all the same briefings as a Senator.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Senate
                                        is a stressful and dangerous place, full of competing
                                        interests and shifting loyalties. The ability to keep
                                        one’s head when being rebuked by a Senator is highly
                                        sought after, as is a composure that betrays no hint of
                                        betrayal when a political alliance is going sour.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">A Senator’s responsibilities keep them on Coruscant much of the time, while those of a Republic
                                        Representative often take them away from the Senate. As an intermediary between their homeworld and
                                        the heart of the Republic, a Republic Representative
                                        is often among the stars, visiting the people of their
                                        world or carrying out assignments for the Senator.
                                        They tend to be more worldly than the full Senators
                                        of the rotunda, and most develop a wide network of
                                        associates among the less politically active communities of their homeworld.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">However, when a Senator has to step away from Coruscant for any reason, they appoint a highly regarded
                                        Republic Representative to act as their proxy and
                                        take on all the roles and responsibilities of a full Senator in the interim. This is often seen as a mark of high
                                        esteem and a first step toward inheriting the position
                                        from the current Senator when their term ends.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">As they are politicians, Republic Representatives
                                        rarely train in martial techniques. The intrigues of the
                                        Senate are complex enough that mastering its intricacies is a lifelong undertaking. Furthermore, the tenets
                                        of the Republic are ones of peace and democracy
                                        rather than strength and valor, so peaceful solutions
                                        are always preferred to violent confrontation. Truly
                                        skilled representatives don’t even need weapons to
                                        defend themselves, for the right words can defuse
                                        a dangerous situation. One might say that Republic
                                        Representatives are never truly unarmed—that their
                                        weapons are smooth charm and sharp critiques.</p>
