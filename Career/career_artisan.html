                                <p class="card-text">Some Force users have an innate skill with tools and machines. These
                                        skilled artificers can use their skill with the Force to enhance their abilities,
                                        and even intuitively understand a machine’s form and function. After all, while tools
                                        and machines may not be alive, the Force envelopes everything in the galaxy. Artisans
                                        feel the Force that surrounds their tools and the items they work on, using this
                                        connection to build creations of wondrous beauty and precision. An Artisan does not
                                        create scores of the same item for sale or distribution. Instead, each of his creations
                                        is individual and iconic, a true work of art.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">In order to fully integrate their Force abilities with the devices they
                                        manipulate, Artisans must first have a solid understanding of how those tools work.
                                        This requires a fundamental educational grounding in the principles of technology.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Within urban environments, individuals who never learn to recognize
                                        their Force talents are prone to follow the Artisan’s path. This is because they
                                        are surrounded by technology, and if these individuals take an interest in how things
                                        work and how to repair them, their Force abilities may naturally develop in concert.
                                        When faced with a broken machine, they can often identify the problem in an intuitive
                                        way—some even claim that the machines “speak” to them. Some Artisans live up to the
                                        stereotype of the messy inventor, while others remain meticulously neat or even take
                                        pains to disguise their craftsmanship from casual observers.</p>

                                                from holographic images for spreading messages to technology intended to
                                                help groups organize. This type of activist focuses on communication: exposing
                                                injustice, informing the public, and distributing vital data to protesters.
                                                An Artisan might realize a connection to the Force by foreseeing a violent
                                                government crackdown and warning the protestors ahead of time, or by fashioning
                                                art that reflects visions of a forgotten and idyllic past or a hopeful future.
                                                Unlike technology fetishists, an Artisan truly knows that art and technology
                                                serve the people, not the other way around.</li>

                                                ones who have the money, leisure time, and interest to live the life of an
                                                Artisan. The traditional Artisan in the cultural elite has a unique position,
                                                creating art that conveys a subversive message while being appreciated by
                                                the very caste the art criticizes. The Artisan with “new money” may instead
                                                be more of a technological aristocrat—the corporate head who produces cutting-edge
                                                science and technology. This kind of Artisan realizes that prior work didn’t
                                                bring about the change envisioned, as greed or apathy warped innovations
                                                for the purposes of profit margins or watered-down entertainment. Ultimately,
                                                the aristocratic Artisan lives with the knowledge that living as a traditional
                                                aristocrat was never truly possible; reflection and inspiration from the
                                                Force broadens personal scope and causes the character to completely reject
                                                the earlier elitist life.</li>

                                                denote allegiances, and communicate with gang members before learning to

                                                left their gangs to expand their work, these former gang leaders never really
                                                abandon their roots. Using everything from low-tech methods (perhaps basic
                                                paint, paper posters, or carvings) to slicing (for instance, slicing a public

                                                while vandalizing surfaces in the richer districts, aiming higher and tackling

                                                Whereas once they were selling an odd piece here and there for profit, they
                                                now design machines to solve specific issues for individuals or entire communities.
                                                These Artisans realize that they can bring help to more people and more actively
                                                seek problems to solve. Instead of simply patching up a fellow laborer’s
                                                cybernetic arm that was damaged on the job, for example, they look for more
                                                permanent solutions, such as better working conditions or different roles
                                                for their fellow citizens. Of course, they still fix the arm.</li>
