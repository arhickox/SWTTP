                                <p class="card-text">An Arbiter knows that often, no matter how hopeless a situation appears,
                                        a path to enlightenment and balance can be achieved through perseverance and negotiation.
                                        An Arbiter channels the nonviolent tendencies of the Consular into active negotiation
                                        between potential allies who have fallen into conflict through misunderstanding or
                                        nefarious influences. Through an understanding of sentient nature and the ebb and
                                        flow of conflict, an Arbiter can often pave the way for a group in the face of the
                                        most violent opposition.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">The career path of a Consular is a wide and varied one leading in such
                                        directions as those of the healer, student, or mystic. The Arbiter has chosen the
                                        path of the negotiator and peacemaker, following an innate impulse to seek peace
                                        and balance in the heated atmosphere of conflict and confusion. An Arbiter is able
                                        to stand between two foes, see to the heart of the conflict between them, and bring
                                        calmness and reconciliation to the situation.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Arbiters are born negotiators. Whether fully aware of their Force powers
                                        or not, they tend to find themselves following the career paths of diplomats and
                                        mediators, seeking to bring peace to the galaxy. Some Consulars work with the Rebel
                                        Alliance, finding like-minded societies and bringing them into the Rebel fold or
                                        helping them to overcome Imperial pressure. However, many do their work in secret,
                                        laboring with a wide variety of corporations, organizations, and other groups to
                                        help bring harmony and tranquility to a war-torn galaxy. Arbiters see the ebb and
                                        flow of pressures and struggles and instinctively sense the fault lines of thought
                                        and belief that perpetuate the violence and conflict bred by miscommunication and
                                        misunderstanding. Arbiters seek to bring balance to the galaxy through negotiation
                                        and reconciliation.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Arbiter understands the importance of calmness, respect, and tact
                                        while dealing with a diverse array of possible allies and potential enemies. Although
                                        many, when confronted with injustice or intransigent negativity, might reach for
                                        their lightsaber, an Arbiterâ€™s first recourse will always be discussion and negotiation.
                                        When the local situation looks completely hopeless, when ancient grudges or new transgressions
                                        threaten to tear a system down into violence and chaos, an Arbiter will be able to
                                        find a path through the bedlam, to see a course of action that will restore peace
                                        and create an environment conducive to the prosperity and contentment of all.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">An Arbiter is skilled in acting as the face of a group, providing an
                                        interface between the group and the authorities controlling its current area of operation.
                                        An Arbiter can assist her group with social interactions, negotiations, and acquisitions,
                                        opening doors that less diplomatic characters may find indelibly closed. The Arbiter
                                        must at all times keep in mind the greater scope of her duties. Peace is always the
                                        ultimate goal, but there is often a bigger picture that must be considered. And when
                                        the time for negotiation is at an end, even Consulars must be ready to use more direct
                                        means, no matter how regretful they may be.

                                                they are beginning to find some small sense of inner peace and hope to bring

                                                two individuals or factions in conflict, guiding them to a deeper understanding
                                                of one another by showing them their commonalities as they struggle to make
                                                their way in the galaxy. By pushing past the Imperial rhetoric that keeps
                                                them divided, the Arbiter can end a seemingly ceaseless feud and provide

                                                the true source of their troubles. As a rogue scholar, the Arbiter is able
                                                to step back from the struggle at hand and view it objectively and with deeper
                                                insight in an effort to present the commonalities of all involved.

                                                tasked with deciding how to keep them safe for future generations. These
                                                decisions include how these things should be preserved and, in some cases,
