                                <p class="card-text">An Ambassador seeks out those who can help a cause and works to ensure
                                        they do. He brings the best arguments he can to sway planets, systems, corporations,
                                        and other groups to side with the forces he serves. The Ambassador brings every possible
                                        asset to bear in order to convince them to see things his way.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Masters of the bargaining process between governments and similar factions,
                                        Ambassadors know how to keep their wits about them and resist being manipulated themselves.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Compromise is a way of life for the Ambassador; he won't even bother
                                        going into a negotiation if he has no room in which to maneuver. The true mastery
                                        of his trade is in getting his most important goals agreed to and making the other
                                        side of the discussion feel like the agreement was its doing. Ambassadors are just
                                        as effective in dealing with individuals in crisis situations as they are in managing
                                        discussions with a room full of skeptical politicians.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Alliance lives and dies on the abilities of its best Ambassadors.
                                        Every time they are able to convince yet another planet, faction, or corporation
                                        to side with the Rebellion, that much more hope spreads throughout the ranks, and
                                        many more resources become available. The upper echelons understand even the end
                                        of the war won't mean an end to the conflict, and that stage will be fully in the
                                        hands of their Ambassadors.</p>

                                                with Ambassadors, instead preferring to simply subjugate local populations.
                                                Flowever, countless officers and agents must maintain order. A former Imperial
                                                Ambassador might have been a minor clerk who tried to do good from inside

                                                oppressed constituency within vast political systems. A good Ambassador can
                                                get even the leader of a much more powerful group to listen through the power
                                                of oratory alone, and can often sway the hearts of the most pragmatic rulers.</li>

                                                These organizations must thus maintain Ambassadors, often called representatives,
                                                lobbyists, or even recruiters. Because many corporations work with the Rebel
