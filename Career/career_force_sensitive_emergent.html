                                <p class="card-text">The Rebel Alliance stands for the restitution of the values and structures that were set aside during the rise 
                                        of Emperor Palpatine. As Force users have been among 
                                        those persecuted under the Imperial regime, many of 
                                        them sympathize with the goals of the Rebellion. As a 
                                        result of this, one of the Rebel Alliance's most underestimated assets is a cadre of amateur Force-sensitives who 
                                        could prove decisive in the struggle against the Empire. 
                                        Or at least, they would be if they were properly identified and trained.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Within the ranks of Rebel organizations, Force-sensitives are safe from the Empire and have access to one 
                                        of the few remaining societies in the galaxy that still 
                                        openly acknowledges and encourages an understanding of the light side of the Force. While the Jedi Order 
                                        has been shattered by the Empire, there are many 
                                        within the Rebel Alliance who remember them and 
                                        their teachings. While few Force-sensitives are ever fortunate enough to receive training from an actual Jedi, 
                                        at least in the Alliance they can learn about the Order's 
                                        traditions and techniques from sympathetic sources.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">While they were regarded by the citizens of the galaxy as a benevolent order dedicated to the promotion 
                                        of peace and harmony throughout the galaxy, the Jedi 
                                        Knights also had a well-deserved reputation as fierce 
                                        warriors, particularly when it came to close-quarters 
                                        fighting with their signature weapon, the lightsaber. 
                                        While few Force-sensitives hope to develop such prowess, or come to possess a lightsaber of their own, they 
                                        do tend to develop some skill at martial arts. In fact, a 
                                        little training in hand-to-hand combat is recommended, 
                                        both as a method of self-protection and because the 
                                        associated regimen is said to help put one in the right 
                                        frame of mind to contemplate the Force. </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Just like other specializations, the Force-Sensitive 
                                        Emergent specialization can be taken at character creation or at any subsequent point. This represents the 
                                        fact that some Force-sensitives do not become aware of 
                                        their potential until a relatively late stage of their lives.</p>
