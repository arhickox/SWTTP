                                <p class="card-text">The Alliance cannot afford to fight a war of attrition the way the Empire
                                        can. The enemy can pour thousands of stormtroopers and other forces into a meat-grinder
                                        of a battle, taking horrific casualties, without blinking an eye over its losses.
                                        Every soldier of the Rebellion is, on the other hand, a valuable asset whose loss
                                        Alliance High Command feels keenly. The Medic serves to prevent as many of those
                                        losses as possible.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Medics know how to keep their head when everyone else is panicking,
                                        and they know how to be prepared for any contingency. They are skilled at treating
                                        the wounds of anyone in their unit, regardless of species.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Many folks think Medics are inherent pacifists. While a Medic might
                                        prefer to save a life rather than take it, most realize the necessity of fighting
                                        and violence for a greater cause, and are more than ready to strike down an enemy
                                        in order to save a comrade. Medics tend to see no one as expendable, which can make
                                        them difficult to deal with when a commander wants to pull a team out of a situation
                                        and there's a chance any of those on the deck could still be alive.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The vast majority of Alliance troopers greatly revere the Medics in
                                        their units, knowing these brave men and women are often the only thing standing
                                        in the way between them and death. Alliance Medics are famous for taking ridiculous
                                        risks in the middle of terrible battles just for the chance to save one more Rebellion
                                        fighter.

                                                preferential treatment, or who had their practice nationalized by the Empire.
                                                Others might have been first responders to the site of an Imperial atrocity.

                                                urban areas, where most children receive higher education and have wealthier
                                                parents. The Alliance takes great care in recruiting these soldiers, and
                                                knows it must win them over by showing them the horrors of the Empire, rather
                                                than tempting them with adventure. Most of these recruits had good lives
                                                before joining, and completed courses in a medical program of some sort.</li>

                                                Imperial Army or Navy. They often have to make a significant adjustment to
                                                life in the Alliance, as they are accustomed to having a near limitless supply
                                                of bacta, bandages, medical droids, and replacement cybernetics. Rebels treasure
                                                every skilled professional who joins their ranks, but never have enough medical
                                                equipment or personnel available, so most Medics are limited to first aid
