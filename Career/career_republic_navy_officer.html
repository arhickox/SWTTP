                                        the brightest military minds within the Republic. The clone army is an effective fighting
                                        force on the ground, but it is only as effective
                                        as the tactical leadership that commands and
                                        supports it from orbit. Drawn from the most
                                        experienced commanders of Republic worlds’
                                        various system defense fleets, the naval officers of the Republic serve as the Grand
                                        Army’s frontline strategic leadership
                                        amid the raging conflict. Even the
                                        Jedi rely on the judgment of the officers they fight beside, as they lack
                                        the experience necessary to conduct large-scale naval actions or
                                        organize troop deployments.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Victory is a moving target, which makes the task
                                        of a Republic Navy Officer
                                        immensely difficult. While the
                                        Separatists have been building
                                        and training their commanders in
                                        secret for years, the Republic leadership was largely unprepared for
                                        the sudden onset of open conflict.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The Jedi and the Senate are
                                        not experienced at waging war,
                                        so they have been forced to
                                        draw their officers from the isolated defense fleets scattered
                                        throughout the Republic, resulting in a diverse group of military
                                        commanders with wildly different skills, training, approaches,
                                        and experiences.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Yet, one thing the officers of the
                                        Republic Navy share is an excellent
                                        tactical and strategic sense. They
                                        are as capable of outmaneuvering
                                        a single dangerous warship as they
                                        are organizing the defense fleet of
                                        an entire star system. Having had to
                                        outwit pirates often before the war,
                                        officers know the spacelanes of the
                                        galaxy and can operate amid dangerous obstacles that would slag less
                                        experienced navigators.
                                        </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Beyond their military expertise, a naval
                                        officer must be a capable leader. Even a
                                        brilliant strategy is useless if the
                                        spacers carrying it out don’t have
                                        faith in their ship or fleet, and
                                        a talented officer inspires that
                                        faith. Whether captaining a single vessel or coordinating the
                                        assault of an entire armada,
                                        a Republic Navy Officer is
                                        a symbol to the crews they
                                        command. Clone troopers
                                        rely on the ships of the
                                        Navy to travel between
                                        worlds and reach the
                                        battlefield, and the best
                                        officers ensure not only
                                        victory in orbital battles, but
                                        pave the way for a successful
                                        ground strike.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">In addition to inspiring the clones
                                        and other crew who serve under
                                        them, many Republic Navy Officers work closely with a Jedi
                                        general. Although a non-Jedi
                                        officer is officially outranked
                                        by their Jedi colleague, the
                                        officer’s military experience
                                        often ensures they serve more
                                        as a mentor than a subordinate, and naval strategies are
                                        frequently developed by the
                                        two working in concert. The Jedi
                                        tend to be more at home directing
                                        ground engagements or leading
                                        starfighter dogfights, leaving the
                                        command of the orbital or interplanetary forces to their trusted
                                        naval commanders.</p>
