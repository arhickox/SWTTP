                                        out of the ordinary. A blaster that works beyond factory tolerances? No problem.
                                        A transponder that identifies a smuggler's freighter as a religious pilgrimage craft?
                                        It'll cost a few credits, but sure. A protocol droid altered to carry out an assassination?
                                        Just how big is that credit line, anyway? </p>
                                <p class="card-text">With his talents, the Outlaw Tech is adept at doing fantastic things
                                        with technology that he probably shouldn't. He's also tough, clever, and adaptable.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Outlaw Techs find the Outer Rim very comfortable. They're able to practice
                                        their unique style of work with far less chance of running afoul of Imperial agents
                                        or other repressive government restrictions. They also find it far easier to make
                                        the contacts and get the kinds of customers that really appreciate their services.
                                        Of course, it's a lot harder to get true stateof- the-art equipment, but making do
                                        with what's on hand is a specialty of the Outlaw Tech.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Outlaw Techs in a Player Character group will be highly prized, especially
                                        for their ability to make all kinds of improvements on other characters' gear. They
                                        are also adept at keeping ships and vehicles operational, and in some situations,
                                        they're as handy at acquiring certain goods as some Explorers. Without a Smuggler
                                        in the group, an Outlaw Tech may be the best bet for dealing with the local black
                                        markets.

                                                other for thousands upon thousands of years—and most have been fighting among
                                                themselves since they arose from the primordial muck of their various homeworlds—
                                                and Outlaw Techs know it. The winners have usually been those who have wielded
                                                the best weapons. Over countless eons of war, the sentient beings of the
                                                galaxy have created an incredible variety of weapons, and some Outlaw Techs
                                                pride themselves on collecting rare pieces from ancient civilizations and
                                                far-flung worlds. Such characters might not only appreciate the efficacy
                                                of such weaponry, but also get a substantial thrill out of adding rare works
                                                to their arsenals.

                                                galaxy could have a natural disdain for regulations and instruction manuals,
                                                sliding into the role of Outlaw Tech. After all, far from the Core Worlds,
                                                warranties are meaningless, and user safety instructions seem like sugges￾tions
                                                at best. Someone with a genius for constructing devices could easily turn
                                                it to the production of arms, perhaps first from retrofitted machine tools
                                                and later from custom-crafted parts made to the finest specifications. A
                                                weaponsmith from the Outer Rim might not see arms dealership as a dirty trade—people
                                                need weapons to defend themselves from creatures and marauders alike in the
                                                lawless wastes, and to suggest otherwise is naive, as the weaponsmith sees
                                                it. However, if such a character was confronted with the harm those weapons
                                                dealt after a lifetime of crafting them, it might force even the most innately
                                                skilled Outlaw Tech to regret pursuing the perfection in arms that felt so
                                                natural at the time.

                                                field are usually on the front lines, testing their technology firsthand.
                                                There is no crucible for development like actual combat, and most Outlaw
                                                Techs who work to advance combat technology to the brink want to be there
                                                to observe the results. The character might work as a mercenary or even
                                                a bounty hunter to find opportunities to push new gear to its breaking point.
                                                Such a character might see combat as part experiment, part technology demo.
                                                An Outlaw Tech of this persuasion is always on the lookout for clients to
                                                impress with new armaments.

                                                characters deep in the underworld is the Outlaw Tech. Many Outlaw Techs openly
                                                embrace the criminal lifestyle and the inherent difficulties and danger,
                                                usually for the credits. An Outlaw Tech might once have been muscle for
                                                a criminal organization, using a deadly array of custom-built weapons and
                                                wargear to eliminate threats, assassinate witnesses, and terrorize anyone
                                                who stood in the syndicate’s way. Whether an Outlaw Tech wields a disruptor,
                                                a personal stealth field, a deflector shield, or a highly customized rifle,
                                                nobody else is as well-suited to maintaining and optimizing such a deadly
                                                arsenal. The Outlaw Tech might custom-build weapons to take out specific
                                                targets, honing blades to pierce the skin of particularly tough creatures,
                                                brewing toxins that affect only certain species, or tailoring environment-specific
                                                camouflage. Usually, leaving a criminal organization is a risky proposition,
                                                but in the case of a brilliant, tech-enhanced killer with a resume of executions
                                                to match, even the most jaded crime boss might have seen the wisdom in letting
                                                the Outlaw Tech walk away unscathed.
