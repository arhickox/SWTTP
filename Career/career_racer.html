                        <div class="card-body">
                                <p class="card-text">Racers race. Whether by landspeeder, airspeeder, starship, or on foot,
                                        the Racer speeds forward to be the first and the fastest. However, the Force grants
                                        not only grants extrasensory insight about the race, but also guides Racers to think
                                        about what the race means.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">For these characters, racing is less about speed and more about knowing
                                        their position in time and space. Racers don’t ask how to get somewhere; they intuit
                                        their arrival at their destinations. In many ways, they push to understand the future
                                        in relation to the positioning of self. The Force, racing forward in time in its
                                        own way, has carved a path that Racers must follow.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">With the Force, physical obstacles aren’t obstacles per se. They represent
                                        perceptual shadows on the fabric of spacetime. Racers use the Force to peer into
                                        these shadows, seeing not only what exists in the shadow, but also when such interactions
                                        exist in the shadow. If they don’t exist in the shadow at all, Racers avoid them.
                                        They were either never supposed to be there, or their life possibly ended before
                                        then. If Racers know they don’t exist at some point in a potential future, then they
                                        can pick a future in which they do.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">As their skills develop, this perception extends from their own relative
                                        position to those of other living beings. Racers become predictive not only about
                                        their own place in spacetime, but also about other beings’ places relative to them.
                                        This allows Racers an eerie ability to be at the right place at the right time to
                                        intercept an individual. Catching a bounty just before the target escapes or rescuing
                                        a person in need at just the right time is an incredible benefit to the community.
                                        In the wrong hands, this talent can be terrifying, as dark side Force users employ
                                        it to tail their target, stalking and harassing with a looming presence at every
                                        turn.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Obviously, Racers must have a calm demeanor and steady hands, even if
                                        the adrenaline rush and excitement of a race would shake the steeliest nerves. Anger
                                        can push them to excessive aggression, and fear can lead to hesitation at the wrong
                                        moment. Mistakes cost lives; not just for Racers' lives but also those of other pilots,
                                        audience members, pit crew, and innocent bystanders. Many Racers claim to attain
                                        a paradoxical stillness in the middle of a race, achieving a transcendental oneness
                                        with vehicle, speed, and self. At this point, the Force flows naturally through them.
                                        However, ordinary, practiced skill in piloting a starship or speeder is a must, for
                                        even Racers can’t rely on the Force alone.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Podracing is the first obvious practical application for this specialization.
                                        The Racer specialization also can be useful with everything from racing on foot to
                                        racing starships. For Racers, notions of time, space, and position become almost
                                        meaningless. Racers can be twelve parsecs away from a target, but close to interception
                                        with a fast hyperdrive, while those on foot may be only a yard away, but separated
                                        by a high, impassable durasteel wall. Which one of these Racers is closer to the
                                        goal?

                                                for activist groups, getting messages to the right people at the right time.
                                                Whether by foot or by vehicle, the Racer also speeds supplies or even people
                                                to where they are needed the most, into and out of danger zones. With governments

                                                the Racer proves more reliable and quicker. The Force is a powerful certainty
                                                in the Racer’s turbulent life, driving the character from hot spot to hot

                                                Popular media darlings, these aristocrats either race expensive vehicles
                                                in underground matches or takes on sponsors in sanctioned public races. However,
                                                Racers take this hobby seriously. To be the best and fastest takes mental
                                                fortitude, physical talent, and unexpected discipline. This desire to be
                                                more than a child of money—a person accepted on his own merits—opened such
                                                Racers to the Force, perhaps even mid-race, and guides their actions still.</li>

                                                in the same way warriors (and brigands) use animals as their steeds. In some
                                                cases, these serve as badges of honor and respect, such that gang leaders
                                                feel compelled to own the most expensive or intricate vehicles. Gang leaders
                                                who once raided enemy gangs or even legal organizations—robbing from the
                                                rich or violent to feed the poor (or themselves)— have moved on to a higher
                                                cause, but their vehicles are still their calling card. Racer gang leaders
                                                may even continue to feel a responsibility to provide escort protection for
                                                community leaders or funeral processions. Racers who lose their vehicle lose
                                                control of their gang, but this frees them to seek belonging elsewhere, embracing
