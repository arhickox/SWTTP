                                <p class="card-text">Consulars are often drawn to their career by a strong sense of compassion.
                                        In many, this is expressed by a desire to mitigate bodily harm and cure the sick.
                                        A Healer trains to do so, recognizing that helping the individual can be just as
                                        important as helping the entirety of galactic civilization.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">For some physicians, healing is focused entirely on the problems of
                                        the body. They treat injuries with a detached, clinical approach. A Healer, however,
                                        is driven by compassion and affinity with the Force. Because of this, a Healer takes
                                        a holistic approach toward medicine. Many Healers learn techniques that use the Force
                                        to fuel the body’s natural recuperative abilities—sometimes transforming a potentially
                                        lethal injury into one that is survivable. They also seek to calm and heal the wounded
                                        spirit just as thoroughly as healing the wounded physical form.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Many Healers have very strong philosophical compunctions against physical
                                        violence. As they spend so much of their lives attempting to heal injuries, they
                                        can be extremely reluctant to inflict them. Consequently, those who study this specialization
                                        exclusively are less likely to gain abilities that are devoted to combat. Some Healers,
                                        however, can take the time to develop defensive techniques, believing that dangerous
                                        situations are often the ones in which they are most needed.</p>

                                                back to haunt those who made them. Healers understand this more than most,
                                                especially given that they are remnants of the Jedi Order. Many Healers see
                                                themselves as the last fragments of the order, having left wounded and weary
                                                from the terrible loss. They see it as their duty to use what gifts they
                                                have to restore those who have been wounded, both physically and spiritually,
                                                by this loss; they quietly set about their task with simple humility and
                                                diligent certainty.

                                                wounded in a conflict. This can lead them in a surprisingly investigative
                                                direction as they search for the spark that ignited the fires of war. By

                                                can prevent turmoil before it can occur. Conversely, many Healers serve as
