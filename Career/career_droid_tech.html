                                <p class="card-text">Droids are prevalent across the galaxy, from the shining spheres of
                                        the Core to dingy backwater worlds far from the center's light. To most inhabitants
                                        of the galaxy. droids are little more than particularly complex tools. However, some
                                        organic sentients find a kinship with these mechanical beings, seeing a spark of
                                        life in them beyond their shells and circuitry. Whether or not they treat the droids
                                        around them as mere objects or as sentient beings, Droid Techs possess an unparalleled
                                        skill at inventing, repairing, and dealing with droids.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Technicians who become Droid Techs gain access to a wealth of abilities
                                        that make them better at creating, repairing. and directing droids. On the edges
                                        of society, droids often constitute much of the labor force due to their low cost-and
                                        for the same reason, these droids are often poorly maintained. A Droid Tech can keep
                                        droids functional and organized better than anyone else, whether this means meticulously
                                        performing upgrades and customizations on a trusted droid partner or keeping a team
                                        of pit droids working at maximum efficiency. Far from official factories and even
                                        from well-stocked garages where replacement parts can be found, a Droid Tech can
                                        be incredibly valuable.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Some Droid Techs are not satisfied to merely main tain mechanical beings,
                                        but actually want to create new, unique droids with unprecedented abililies and features.
                                        Custom-built droids are not as common as standard models, but they are not especially
                                        rare, either. The most skilled Droid Techs can bring extremely complex creations
                                        to life, building droids that perform a single task with mechanical precision or
                                        versatile models capable of handling any situation the galaxy throws at them. The
                                        deep philosophical and ethical ramifications of creating sentient beings for a purpose
                                        weighs heavily on the minds of a few, of course, but most citizens of the galaxy
                                        do not dwell too long on such matters.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">In addition to having abilities that facilitate building and repairing
                                        droids, Droid Techs are gifted with a knack for convincing droids to actually do
                                        things for them. While some droids are well mannered and helpful, others can be ill-tempered,
                                        capricious, or even downright cruel-but also too useful to dispense with entirely.
                                        Getting difficult droids to work toward the group's common good can be quite a task,
                                        but a skilled Droid Tech is better equipped for this task than anyone else. To this
                                        end, in addition to benefiting from a high Intellect, Droid Techs might also find
                                        a high Presence characteristic and ranks in the Leaderst1ip skill useful. These have
                                        has the added benefit of making it easier to deal with organic beings-though if some
                                        Droid Techs prefer to avoid dealing with organics entirely.

                                                droids have existed since time immemorial. However, unlike most other advanced
                                                constructs, droids are capable of self-modification. A Droid Tech with an
                                                interest in antiquity might seek out unique droids that pushed their own
                                                evolution in strange and innovative ways. Finding even a fragment of such
                                                a being might provide months of work for the character in dissecting the
                                                surviving hardware and code to understand the being’s ideas, motives, and
                                                thoughts. An organic being might pursue this path, but so too might a droid,
                                                especially one who wishes to understand the complexities of its own existence
                                                as a being of artifice.

                                                because of them. An up-and-coming Droid Tech might have decided to tackle
                                                the problem of making friends in a literal fashion, crafting a droid companion
                                                to understand the character as others did not. Whether or not these efforts

                                                a strange sidestep in evolution—most see them as simulacra of intelligent
                                                beings rather than as entities in their own right. However, some organic
                                                Droid Techs (and more than a few droids) believe these mechanical beings
                                                to be the logical successors to the concept of “life.” After all, droids
                                                are theoretically immortal, their intelligences can be untethered from their
                                                bodies, and they can adapt both their bodies and minds dramatically to new
                                                circumstances with incredible speed; few organic species can boast such qualities.
                                                And while droids have rarely occupied places of galactic prestige, evolution
                                                can be a slow process followed by explosive change. A few eccentric droid
                                                designers even believe that in pushing the development of droids forward,
                                                life grows ever closer to perfection.
