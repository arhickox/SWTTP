                                <p class="card-text">The Jedi and the Sith are not the sole masters of the
                                        Force. The Force awakens in all manner of beings
                                        from all walks of life, and while many Force sensitives
                                        are discovered by the Jedi—or on rare occasions, by
                                        the Sith—no one can say how many go unrecorded.
                                        Some Force sensitives receive training in the ways of
                                        the Jedi or Sith only to leave in pursuit of their own
                                        agendas, whether by choice or expulsion. These are
                                        the Force-Sensitive Outcasts, the independent Force
                                        users who stay on the outskirts
                                        of the galaxy and reject the
                                        dogma of the Jedi and the
                                        Sith. With a lightsaber at
                                        their side and the power of
                                        the Force at their fingertips,
                                        a Force-Sensitive Outcast is
                                        master of their own destiny.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Life isn’t easy for a Force-Sensitive Outcast, who
                                        must contend not only with the political might of the
                                        Republic and the Separatists, but also with the reach of the Jedi
                                        and the Sith. Many characters who forge their own
                                        path do so as smugglers, bounty hunters, or criminals,
                                        using their talents to gain wealth or influence outside
                                        of the law. Yet, a Force-Sensitive Outcast is not necessarily an outlaw at heart, and their clashes with
                                        Republic authority may stem from personal conflicts
                                        with the Jedi Order.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The doctrine of the Jedi is not welcoming to everyone, and the restrictions on attachment often conflict
                                        with a Force-Sensitive Outcast’s values. Some Padawans are naturally adept with the dark side of the Force,
                                        strongly feeling its pull no matter how hard they try to
                                        heed their masters’ teachings. In rare cases, a Force
                                        user might receive training from a Sith Lord, whether
                                        within the confines of the Rule of Two or as a secret
                                        apprentice. Other Force users might find that their
                                        desire for freedom outweighs the benefit of having a
                                        mentor, leading them to choose the self-taught path.
                                        This may eventually bring them into contact with the
                                        Jedi or Sith—if that is the will of the Force.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">The reach of the Jedi is long, but not all-encompassing. Those who have rejected the Jedi or evaded or
                                        refused recruitment are masters at survival and subterfuge, using the Force and their own self-sufficiency
                                        to help them persist in a harsh galaxy. Experience is
                                        an effective teacher, and Force-Sensitive Outcasts are
                                        uniquely situated to learn all manner of tricks and tactics. Despite having little or no proper training in the
                                        ways of the Force, such iconoclasts may have skills
                                        that rival or exceed those of Jedi in certain areas.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Due to the abundance of Force users during the
                                        time of the Republic, it is possible for a non-Jedi to
                                        acquire a lightsaber. The blade of a fallen Jedi has
                                        ^been known to appear on the black market, and
                                        those who train with the Jedi or
                                        the Sith often walk away
                                        with their own lightsaber, regardless of the
                                        circumstances of the
                                        parting. However a Force-Sensitive Outcast acquires
                                        such a weapon, it becomes a tangible symbol of their
                                        unique talents.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Many of a Force-Sensitive Outcast’s combat skills
                                        are likely self-taught, making their battle techniques
                                        diverse and unpredictable. They often fight with a
                                        pieced-together combination of different formal lightsaber styles, remembering elements of their training
                                        (if they had any) and the maneuvers of other lightsaber-wielding combatants, and incorporating them
                                        into traditional sword-fighting techniques—with a fair
                                        amount of improvisation. A Force-Sensitive Outcast
                                        may be a less refined warrior than a Jedi or Sith, but
                                        they are no less deadly.</p>
