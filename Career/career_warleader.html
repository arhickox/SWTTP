                                <p class="card-text">Not all Guardians solve their problems through feats of prowess with
                                        the lightsaber alone. The mind can be a deadlier weapon still, and a little foresight
                                        can do as much to win a battle as the greatest feat of heroism. The Warleader possesses
                                        a number of tricks and abilities that help to carry the day in battle, and more importantly,
                                        to keep friends and allies alive to fight another day.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Warleaders are calculating fighters who rely more on mental acuity and
                                        guile than on raw combat strength. While Warleaders are capable combatants in their
                                        own right, thanks to their ranged combat skills, their greatest edge comes when they
                                        have comrades-in-arms to guide in battle. Unlike Peacekeepers, Warleaders do not
                                        focus on inspiring others; while individual Warleaders might indeed be charismatic,
                                        their friends trust them with their lives not because of rousing speeches, but because
                                        of their reliability in the field. Warleaders might not protect their allies by deftly
                                        deflecting blaster shots with a lightsaber or heroically taking blows meant for them,
                                        but their guidance can keep comrades safe just the same.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Whether through formal military training, practical combat experience,
                                        or simply having keen minds, PCs who take on this specialization are well-equipped
                                        to handle matters of strategy and tactics. Warleaders often have an intuitive grasp
                                        of the field of combat thanks to their connection to the Force, and combine this
                                        with shrewd tactics to concoct and execute forward-thinking plans that seem almost
                                        prescient to their foes. Cover is an especially valuable resource for Warleaders.
                                        They can use it not only to grant their comrades additional defensive benefits, but
                                        also to gain the edge over enemies by guiding allies to strike from unexpected angles.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Trust is the foundation of any Warleader’s command. More often than
                                        not, a party of Player Characters consists of a group of equals pursuing a common
                                        goal rather than a formally structured organization. Even if one PC is nominally
                                        in charge, that person might or might not be the Warleader. When battle breaks out,
                                        however, the Warleader keeps friends out of the line of fire, exposes weaknesses
                                        in enemy plans, and comes up with cunning strategies that catch foes off guard.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text">Outside of battle, the Warleader’s acute problem-solving skills can
                                        also be very useful, as can the character’s foresight. Regardless of the situation,
                                        the Warleader can look at challenges from an angle others might have neglected. In
                                        doing, so, the Warleader can help lead the group to victory through unexpected
                                        solutions.

                                                of one specific ancient tradition to benefit from the wisdom of history.
                                                This character studies the techniques of a thousand conflicts and the tenets
                                                of a hundred fellowships. The Warleader can draw upon knowledge of the past
                                                to predict future events. This might mean studying the strategies and tactics
                                                of ancient leaders so that the Warleader can glean new tricks from the pages
                                                of history. Of course, such a character must still keep in mind the practical
                                                limits and applications of tactics. A Warleader needs a strong wit to adapt
                                                academic knowledge of the past into practical plans on the field of battle,
                                                and an even stronger bond with friends and allies to execute these tactics
                                                effectively.

                                                background might have been raised to command, and thus expect obedience from
                                                comrades-in-arms. However, loyalty must be earned, especially among Force-sensitive
                                                fugitives in the era of the Empire. Few heroes will follow an arrogant or
                                                dismissive leader, even if that person is often correct about matters of
                                                strategy. Such a character would have to learn respect for others to earn
                                                comrades’ esteem, and then their cooperation.

                                                as any enemy, it pays to know the terrain and to pit one threat against another.
                                                A Warleader with this background might even have become dedicated to preserving
                                                the region from exploitation and other threats.

                                                to see the galaxy after a tour of military duty. Travel might have made the
                                                character more aware of the injustices the galaxy holds, and the Warleader
                                                may have decided to face these challenges head-on using skills acquired in
                                                the field. Warleaders have a knack for helping others help themselves, and
                                                this is an extremely valuable skill when one seeks to affect real change.
                                                Saving people today does not solve their problems for tomorrow, but teaching
                                                people to save themselves can help them dramatically improve their lives.
