    <p>Centuries ago, the <b>Bith</b> homeworld, Clak’dor VII, was a strong member of the Galactic Senate. Its citizens traveled
      widely, debated science and philosophy, and helped their world and the galaxy prosper intellectually and economically.</p>
    <p>Clak’dor VII was divided into city-states. Though chaotic, this method of governance functioned smoothly until the
      Nozho-Weogar War. The civil war between these city-states was short-lived but devastating. Both launched chemical,
      biological, and mutagenic weapons that shattered the ecosystem and eventually claimed nearly all of the planetary population.
      Offworld Bith tried to return, but the Bith governments set up a planetwide quarantine. Unafflicted Bith scattered
      across the Outer Rim to work and to find aid for their homeworld.</p>
    <p>In the three centuries since, the Bith have suffered the effects of losing a homeworld without actually losing it.
      The quarantine convinced outsiders that the Bith carried a plague. Since all of the economic support went to repairing
      their planet, Bith colonies and outposts dissolved or integrated with other communities. Clak’dor VII virtually disappeared
      from galactic life. Although the planet-bound Bith have stabilized their culture and governments, the planet has remained
      toxic. A cultural split endures between those on Clak’dor VII and the other Bith, but all use the war as an object
      lesson on the futility of violence.</p>
    <p>Disillusionment with the Republic led the Bith to side with the Separatists, although not in a military capacity.
      Not only did they object to the corruption of the Republic (which mirrored their own before their civil war), but the
      Confederacy of Independent Systems promised much-needed supplies and aid. With the collapse of the Republic, the Bith
      now face the wrath of the Empire, which uses Separatist worlds as scapegoats for various propaganda purposes.</p>
    <p>Bith have a strong history of adaptation. They survived the loss and slow restoration of their home￾world, and they
      continue to adjust to life under Imperial rule. As the Galactic Civil War grows, the Bith not only must adapt to the
      idea of widespread warfare, but must decide which side to support.</p>

            <p>With their large eyes, high cranial bone, and lack of a prominent nasal organ, the Bith are one of the more
              recognizable species. Their large black pupils allow for a wide range of wavelengths, giving them exceptional
              eyesight. They have olfactory facial folds, but don’t use them to breathe; instead, they absorb air through
              their skin. Despite the lack of any obvious aural organs, Bith have sensitive hearing. While tales of Bith

            <p>Bith pacifism arises less out of cultural tradition than historical exhaustion. After the terrible civil war
              left their homeworld devastated, pacifism became their watchword. They continued to have a voice in the Galactic
              Senate, but centuries of begging for aid to repair their homeworld left them convinced of the Republic’s corruption
              and ineffectualness. Bith are a species both with a home and without.</p>
            <p>The Republic’s war with the Separatists and the subsequent rise of the Rebellion have placed the Bith in an
              uncomfortable position. Centuries without a stable homeworld have taught them that violence solves nothing,
              but the Empire’s persecution threatens to destroy what culture they have managed to preserve.</p>
            <p>Bith also struggle with the legacy of their civil war in the form of offshoot subspecies such as the Y’bith.
              The war’s resultant mutations killed many, but those who survived stabilized their genetic drifts through bioengineering.
              Now a distinct and separate sub-species, the Y’bith are similar in appearance to their genetic cousins, with
              darker and more orange skin and more pronounced facial features and fingers. The Y’bith endure a high level
              of social prejudice from the Bith even though they have the same legal rights.</p>

            <p>he Bith reputation for musical skill started as a misperception and exaggeration. After migrating to the Outer
              Rim, many struggled to make a living. Some found themselves in one of the few available occupations: entertainment.
              Bith have the same level of musical skill as any other species, but those who thrived as musicians became known
              for their abilities. Bith in the Alliance have often used this reputation as a cover, as few would think twice
              about performers at a local cantina.</p>
            <p>A number of Bith engineers have also designed specialized musical instruments. Alliance spies have used these
