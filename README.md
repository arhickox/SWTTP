# SWTTP - Star Wars Tabletop Project

This is a constantly in-progress compendium website for the Edge of the Empire, Age of Rebellion and Force and Destiny tabletop roleplaying games by Fantasy Flight Games.

It is far from finished, so plain sections like the main index will be visually reworked in time.

## Sections and Progress
- **Species** - Complete with all current content 
- **Careers** - In-Progress, some button artwork missing and Age of Rebellion section unfinished
- **Obligations** - Complete
- **Motivations** - Section structure done, but most pages unmade
- **Weapons** - Brawling, Melee and Lightsabers finished (Core Rulebook only)
- **Adversaries** - Galactic Underworld (Core Rulebook only) finished
- **Planets** - Some button art only, page templating still in progress
- **Name Generator** - Finished for now

Navbar is largely broken since recent folder organization rework, will be fixed once final layout of website determined. As of now only home button works and only on main index pages
