    <p>The <b>Caamasi</b> are a species of furred humanoids recovering from the brink of extinction. Their pacifist society
      integrated with the Old Republic early in galactic history, working to maintain peace, stability, and freedom. For
      millennia, Caamasi were trusted advisors and mediators throughout the Republic, and many served as Jedi Knights.</p>
    <p>For all their dutiful service and loyalty, the Caamasi’s stubborn refusal to participate in the Republic’s militarization
      during the Clone Wars made them enemies of the new Empire. Shortly after his coronation, Emperor Palpatine secretly
      arranged for the destruction of the Caamasi homeworld. Although his involvement is not public knowledge, many Caamasi
      suspect that he could not tolerate the idea of a species loyal to the Old Republic or its ideals operating within the
      heart of his New Order in the Core Worlds.</p>
    <p>Although the Caamasi have suffered greatly since the rise of the Empire, they have refused to yield to oppression.
      They maintain their old traditions in defiance of their recent trials, including favoring peaceful solutions over lashing
      out with violence. Not even the loss of their homeworld has broken their spirit or transformed their culture. The unique
      capability to share certain important memories, or memnn, among members of their species aids them, as the Caamasi
      elders pass on the teachings of peace more vividly than words could.</p>

              hands are unusually thin, with only three fingers, but Caamasi can grip a blaster or datapad firmly. Perhaps
              the most unusual aspect of their appearance is a beak-like snout, lined with sharp teeth, creating a far more

              the Caamasi remained firmly dedicated throughout the Separatist Crisis. Flowever, the Caamasi opposed the Republic’s
              armament for the Clone Wars, including the Senate’s adoption of clone troopers, so the Caamasi lobbied for
              a peaceful end to the conflict. Both their love of the Republic and their condemnation of its war effort led
              the emergent Empire to label the Caamasi as dissidents, leading to the bombardment of their homeworld and the

            <p>The planet <b>Caamas</b> is the second planet in the Cirius system, along the Commenor Run hyperlane in the
              Core Worlds. Once a temperate world with a highly varied climate and ecosystem, Caamas is now scorched and
              polluted beyond habitability. Shortly after the rise of the Empire, the planet was bombarded by Star Destroyers
              on the Emperor’s orders. The planetary shields were lowered by infiltrating agents, allowing the orbital firepower
              to saturate the planet. The little life that survived the assault was devastated by the total collapse of the
              planet’s ecosystem and the firestorms that raged across the planet’s surface for years.</p>
            <p>The Caamasi species was reduced to a slim fraction of its former numbers, but a new generation has since pulled
              them from the brink of extinction. Officially, the devastation wrought on Caamas was the result of bombs planted
              by the Separatists, and too few survivors made it offworld to contradict the Imperial propaganda. However,
              many Caamasi find the Empire’s story too convenient for their liking, especially in the wake of the destruction
              of Alderaan. The Rebellion is a popular cause for the new generation of Caamasi, who join in the hope that
              no one else loses a homeworld to the Empire.</p>

              languages of other species they encounter, and a Caamasi without fluency in Basic is practically unheard of.
              Their emphasis on learning the languages of others may have put their own language in danger, but surviving

          <p>Unsurprisingly, Caamasi tend toward occupations that fit their affinity for peaceful resolutions and nonviolent
            action. Many serve as mediators and ambassadors for the Rebellion, but other outlets for their pacifist attitude
            are common as well. Caamasi with a technical or scientific aptitude might become mechanics or doctors, seeking
            to fix what war has broken.</p>
          <p>Despite their pacifist inclinations, Caamasi serving among the Rebels are likely to be more accustomed to violence
            than others of their kind. When operating in such circumstances, taking the life of Imperial soldiers and operatives
            might be seen as a regrettable necessity in order to protect countless more lives, and a personal sacrifice for
            the greater good. Those who take this step usually do so with the utmost commitment, and they are as painstaking
            in their efforts to eradicate the Empire as they are in avoiding collateral damage and unnecessary casualties.</p>

          <p>A memnis is an imprinted Caamasi experience, more vivid than a normal memory, and it never loses its intensity.
            When a Caamasi experiences a memnis, the recollection is always the same, whether shortly after the event has
            taken place or long after, through a memnis that has been passed down for generations. The process of sharing
            memnii is commonly thought of as passing down remembrances of past events, but this is not entirely accurate.</p>
          <p>Sharing memnii does not entirely improve the Caamasi’s powers of recollection, as the creation of memnii cannot
            be controlled, and details that were not observed at the time of its formation are cloudy upon reflection. However,
            when a Caamasi views a memnis, he can be entirely certain of what was experienced at the time.</p>
          <p>If a Caamasi shares a relevant memnis with a member of his species, his fellow would have great difficulty refuting
            an argument drawing upon the evidence within the memnis. At the GM’s discretion, this can be reflected with one
            or more ■ on subsequent checks to convince the recipient of the Caamasi’s sincerity.</p>
          <p>Spending too much time observing memnii can leave a psychological strain on a Caamasi, leading to an obsession
            with past events or an excess of emotion welling from the power of the memory. Even positive memnii, such as
            a time spent with a loved one or meeting a personal idol, can be dangerous if the Caamasi dwells too deeply and
            ignores his present life. As such, the Caamasi view memnii with both reverence and caution, and treat every shared
            memnis as a significant occasion.</p>
          <p>As the few Caamasi old enough to remember their homeworld and history grow fearful of their memories vanishing
            from the galaxy, this attitude is being tested. The younger generation may be able to take up the keeping of
            their species’ history, or they may be overwhelmed as too much is pressed upon them.</p>
