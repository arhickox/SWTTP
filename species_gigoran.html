    <p><b>Gigorans</b> are massive, burly primates with long, pale fur. Often sold into slavery, Gigorans remain peaceful
      as long as they are with family. However, should their kin be threatened, there is no sacrifice too great or foe too
      terrifying to stop Gigorans from trying to help. Their huge form and powerful musculature allow them to carry weapons
      larger than many humans. Those Gigorans who wield them delight in the massive firepower they can project against their
      foes.

            <p>Well over two meters of sinew and fur each, Gigorans are often mistaken for Wookiees or wampas. Their long,
              flowing hair is typically a pale shade of white, cream, gold, or even blue. Their long torso and arms are at
              odds with their relatively short, stumpy legs. Nevertheless, their limbs are thick and powerful, ending in
              massive paws. The hair atop their head often grows long, sometimes obscuring their dark eyes, and it tends
              to come in blackish streaks.</p>
            <p>Gigorans have an abridged chin, making their face appear short and wide. Many wear small, rectangular breathing
              masks to aid in respiration in warmer climates, with chest-mounted devices to better adjust local atmospheres
              to their respiratory systems.</p>

            <p>Despite their imposing nature, Gigorans are gentle and affectionate unless pushed to violence. They live in
              deep caves in the snowy mountains of Gigor, organized into home-clans of about fifty individuals, each led
              by its most skilled hunter. Home-clans rarely live close enough to each other to interact. When they do interact,
              the occasion is often marked with month-long feasts and weddings to promote genetic diversity. Gigorans live
              a simple existence hunting icetrompers in the mountain valleys and gathering edible berries, mosses, and molds
              from their home caves. Gigorans are curious to a fault, making them easy marks for unscrupulous offworlders.</p>
            <p>Offworld, Gigorans are interested in everything around them. They are particularly compelled by any shiny
              bit of technology and can stare at random blinking lights for hours. Pack instinct draws Gigorans toward friendly
              beings, to whom they offer their strength in exchange for camaraderie. Gigorans quickly accept allies, eventually
              defending them as if they were family.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, some exploit this tendency and lure otherwise good-hearted Gigorans down darker paths. Gigorans
              who have been victimized one time too many may grow jaded, grumpy, and violent. This is especially true of
              those who were enslaved or faced the Empire’s standard persecution of non-humans. Such Gigorans gravitate toward
              work involving combat, offering their brute strength and love of massive weaponry to any who can afford their
              services.

              separate species from <b>Gigor</b>, a frigid planet in the Outer Rim’s Tynquay sector. The snow-covered world
              is a rocky and mountainous place where only the hardiest specimens of life survive for long. The caves that
              riddle the mountains are home to Gigorans, jexxel cats, and snow shredder bats. Deep within many caves, hot
              springs enable edible molds and mushrooms to thrive. The valleys between mountains are filled with hardy shrubs,
              mosses, and coniferous trees, providing an ecosystem for rodent-like ice scrabblers, giant icetrompers, and
              even jakobeasts.</p>

              driving them to lives of violence as mercenaries, resistance fighters, or bounty hunters. Others flail for
              purpose until they make friends and grow close enough to consider them family. Gigorans who do so are apt to

            <p>Early surveys of Gigor listed it as uninhabited; Gigorans went undiscovered by the Republic until a Weequay
              pirate in hiding stumbled across the lumbering natives. Sensing opportunity, the pirate captain tricked an
              entire home-clan into slavery, selling them to an Imperial labor camp as rare “Snow Wookiees. ” Other slavers
              duplicated his ploy, and since Gigoran home-clans rarely interact, they continued to fall for it. Eventually,
              the Empire caught on and deployed a garrison to Gigor. Imperials enslave entire home-clans daily, shipping
              them to Imperial construction projects across the galaxy.</p>
