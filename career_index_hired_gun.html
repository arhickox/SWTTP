                                <p class="card-text">When it comes to fighting, the Hired Gun is at the forefront. He's less
                                        of an independent operator than the Bounty Hunter, preferring to have a defined mission,
                                        an objective to achieve, and some credits to spend when the job is done. Hired Guns
                                        are muscle and applied force, meant to defend or attack as the situation requires.
                                        They deal damage or protect others for credits, and this makes them simple and sometimes
                                        refreshngly direct.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">A Hired Gun one typically encounters in the Outer Rim ikely came from
                                        one of three kinds of backgrounds; he may have been a soldier for the Empire (or,
                                        possibly, even for the Old Republic before its fall), he might have served with a
                                        planetary or organizational force of some kind, or he simply came up hard, learning
                                        how to shoot and fight because that was the only way he could survive. However he
                                        came by them, the Hired Gun has the kinds of skills and talents that make it fairly
                                        easy to find work in the Outer Rim and the fringes of society.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Many Hired Guns are true mercenaries, either working for themselves
                                        or contracted to a guild or company of some kind. Much like Bounty Hunters, the Hired
                                        Guns who are part of a guild tend to enjoy a great deal of support. They do not,
                                        however, have much in the way of freedom. More than a few Hired Guns have walked
                                        away from contracts that either violated their personal ethics or left them feeling
                                        completely exploited with terrible terms of service. Unfortunately, such mercenaries
                                        are left watching their backs for years after.</p>
                                <p class="card-text">Independent Hired Guns enjoy the greatest freedom, yet they also spend
                                        a lot of time just trying to find a good job, and preferably one that doesn't give
                                        them a life expectancy measured in days. Reputation can mean everything for such
                                        professionals, yet a simple test of skills and competency may often result in a better
                                        arrangement if the right employer is impressed.</p>
